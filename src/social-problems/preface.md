# Preface

The first eleven chapters of this book are revised from articles published in Frank Leslie's Illustrated Newspaper, during the first half of this year, under the title of "Problems of the Time." In the chapters which follow, I have more fully developed the lines of thought there begun. My endeavor has been to present the momentous social problems of our time, unincumbered by technicalities, and without that abstract reasoning which some of the principles of Political Economy require for thorough explanation. I have spoken in this book of some points not touched upon, or but lightly touched upon, in "Progress and Poverty," but there are other points as to which I think it would be worth the while of those who may be interested by this book to read that.
