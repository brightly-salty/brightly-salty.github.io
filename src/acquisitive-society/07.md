# The Liberation of Industry

Rights without functions are like the shades in Homer, which drank blood but scattered trembling at the voice of a man. To extinguish royalties and urban ground-rents is merely to explode a superstition. It needs as little---and as much---resolution as to put one's hand through any other ghost. In all industries except the diminishing number in which the capitalist is himself the manager, property in capital is almost equally passive.

Almost, but not quite. For, though the majority of its owners do not themselves exercise any positive function, they appoint those who do. It is true, of course, that the question of how capital is to be owned is distinct from the question of how it is to be administered, and that the former can be settled without prejudice to the latter. Shareholders own capital which is indispensable to industry, but it does not therefore follow that industry is dependent upon the maintenance of capital in the hands of shareholders. To write, with some economists, as though, if private property in capital were further attenuated or abolished altogether, the constructive energy of the managers who may own capital or may not, but who rarely, in the more important industries, own more than a small fraction of it, must necessarily be impaired, is to be guilty of a robust non-sequitur and to ignore the most obvious facts of contemporary industry. The less the mere capitaHst talks about the necessity for the consumer of an efficient organization of industry, the better; for, whatever the future of industry may be, an efficient organization is likely to have no room for *him*. But though shareholders do not govern, they reign, at least to the extent of saying once a year "*le roy le veult.*" If their rights are pared down or extinguished, the necessity for some organ to exercise them will still remain. And the question of the ownership of capital has this much in common with the question of industrial organization, that the problem of the constitution under which industry is to be conducted is common to both.

## (a) Industry as a Profession

That constitution must be sought by considering how industry can be organized to express most perfectly the principle of purpose. The application to industry of the principle of purpose is simple, however difficult it may be to give effect to it. It is to turn it into a Profession. A Profession may be defined most simply as a trade which is organized, incompletely, no doubt, but genuinely, for the performance of function. It is not simply a collection of individuals who get a living for themselves by the same kind of work. Nor is it merely a group which is organized exclusively for the economic protection of its members, though that is normally among its purposes. It is a body of men who carry on their^ work in accordance with rules designed to enforce certain standards both for the better protection of its members and for the better service of the public.

The standard which it maintains may be high or low: all professions have some rules which protect the interests of the community and others which are an imposition on it. Its essence is that it assumes certain responsibilities for the competence of its members or the quality of its wares, and that it deliberately prohibits certain kinds of conduct on the ground that, though they may be profitable to the individual, they are calculated to bring into disrepute the organization to which he belongs. While some of its rules are trade union regulations designed primarily to prevent the economic standards of the profession being lowered by unscrupulous competition, others have as their main object to secure that no member of the profession shall have any but a purely professional interest in his work, by excluding the incentive of speculative profit. Business men may cajole the public from every hoarding. But doctors, architects, consulting engineers, and even lawyers are prohibited by their professional associations from advertising, from having any pecuniary interest in the treatment or course of action recommended to their clients, or from receiving commissions. The fees which the more eminent among them charge for their professional services may often be excessive. But they may charge for professional services and for nothing else.

The conception implied in the words "unprofessional conduct" is, therefore, the exact opposite of the theory and practice which assume that the service of the public is best secured by the unrestricted pursuit on the part of rival traders of their pecuniary self-interest, within such limits as the law allows. It is significant that at the time when the professional classes had deified free competition as the arbiter of commerce and industry, they did not dream of applying it to the occupations in which they themselves were primarily interested, but maintained, and indeed, elaborated, machinery through which a professional conscience might find expression. The rules themselves may sometimes appear to the layman arbitrary and ill-conceived. But their object is clear. It is to impose on the profession itself the obligation of maintaining the quality of the service, and to prevent its common purpose being frustrated through the undue influence of the motive of pecuniary gain upon the necessities or cupidity of the individual.

The difference between industry as it exists today and a profession is, then, simple and unmistakable. The former is organized for the protection of *rights*, mainly rights to pecuniary gain, The latter is organized, imperfectly indeed, but none the less genuinely, for the performance of *duties*. The essence of the one is that its only criterion is the financial return which it offers to its shareholders. The essence of the other, is that, though men enter it for the sake of livelihood, the measures of their success is the service which they perform, not the gains which they amass. They may, as in the case of a successful doctor, grow rich; but the meaning of their profession, both for themselves and for the public, is not that they make money but that they make health, or safety, or knowledge, or good government or good law. They depend on it for their income, but they do not consider that any conduct which increases their income is on that account right. And while a boot-manufacturer who retires with half a million is counted to have achieved success, whether the boots which he made were of leather or brown paper, a civil servant who did the same would, very properly, be prosecuted.

So, if men are doctors, they recognize that there are certain kinds of conduct which cannot be practised, however large the fee offered for them, because they are unprofessional; if scholars and teachers, that it is wrong to make money by deliberately deceiving the public, as is done by makers of patent medicines, however much the public may clamour to be deceived; if judges or public servants, that they must not increase their incomes by selling justice for money; if soldiers, that the service comes first, and their private inclinations, even the reasonable preference of life to death, second. Every country has its traitors, every army its deserters, and every profession its blacklegs. To idealize the professional spirit would be very absurd; is has its sordid side, and, if it is to be fostered in industry, safeguards will be needed to check its excesses. Clearly, a profession should not have the final voice in deciding the charge to be made for its services. It ought not by itself to determine the conditions on which new members are to be admitted. It should not have so exclusive a control even of its own technique as to be in a position to meet proposals for improvement with the determined obstructiveness which the legal profession has offered, for example, to the registration of land. But there is all the difference between maintaining a standard which is occasionally abandoned, and affirming as the central truth of existence that there is no standard to maintain. The meaning of a profession is that it makes the traitors the exception, not, as they tend to be in industry, the rule. It makes them the exception by upholding as the criterion of success the end for which the profession, whatever it may be, is carried on, and subordinating the inclinations, appetites and ambitions of individuals to the rules of an organization which has as its object to promote the performance of function.

There is no sharp line between the professions and the industries. A hundred years ago the trade of teaching, which to-day is on the whole an honourable public service, was rather a vulgar speculation upon public credulity; if Mr. Squeers was a caricature, the Oxford of Gibbon and Adam Smith was a solid port-fed reality; no local authority could have performed one-tenth of the duties which are carried out by a modern municipal corporation every day, because there was no body of public servants to perform them, and such as there were took bribes. It is conceivable, at least, that some branches of medicine might have developed on the lines of industrial capitalism, with hospitals as factories, doctors hired at competitive wages as their "hands," large dividends paid to shareholders by catering for the rich, and the poor, who do not offer a profitable market, supplied with an inferior service or with no service at all.

The idea that there is some mysterious difference^ between making munitions of war and firing them,, between building schools and teaching in them when built, between providing food and providing health, which makes it at once inevitable and laudable that the former should be carried on with a single eye to pecuniary gain, while the latter are conducted by professional men, who expect to be paid for their services, but who neither watch for windfalls nor raise their fees merely because there are more sick to be cured, more children to be taught, or more enemies to be resisted, is an illusion only less astonishing than that the leaders of industry should welcome the insult as an honour and wear their humiliation as a kind of halo. The work of making boots or building a house is in itself no more degrading than that of curing the sick or teaching the ignorant. It is as necessary and therefore as honourable. It should be at least equally bound by rules which have as their object to maintain the standards of professional service. It should be at least equally free from the vulgar subordination of moral standards to financial interests.

If industry is to be organized as a profession, two changes are requisite, one negative and one positive. The first, is that it should cease to be conducted by the agents of property-owners for the advantage of property-owners, and should be carried on, instead, for the service of the public. The second, is that, subject to rigorous public supervision, the responsibility for the maintenance of the service should rest upon the shoulders of those, from organizer and scientist to labourer, by whom, in effect, the work is conducted.

The first change is necessary because the conduct of industry for the public advantage is impossible as long as the ultimate authority over its management is vested in those whose only connection with it, and interest in it, is the pursuit of gain. As industry is at present organized, its profits and its control belong by law to that element in it which has least to do with its success. Under the joint-stock organization which has become normal in all the more important industries except agriculture and building, it is managed by the salaried agents of those by whom the property is owned. It is successful if it returns large sums to shareholders, and unsuccessful if it does not. If an opportunity presents itself to increase dividends by practices which deteriorate the service or degrade the workers, the officials who administer industry act strictly within their duty if they seize it, for they are the servants of their employers, and their obligation to their employers is to provide dividends not to provide service. But the owners of property are, *qua* property-owners, functionless, not in the sense, of course, that the tools of which they are the proprietors are not useful, but in the sense that since work and ownership are increasingly separated, the efficient use of the tools is not dependent on the maintenance of the proprietary rights exercised over them. Of course there are many managing directors who both own capital and administer the business. But it is none the less the case that most shareholders in most large industries are normally shareholders and nothing more.

Nor is their economic interest identical, as is sometimes assumed, with that of the general public. A society is rich when material goods, including capital, are cheap, and human beings dear; indeed the word "riches" has no other meaning. The interest of those who own the property used in industry, though not, of course, of the managers who administer industry and who themselves are servants, and often very ill-paid servants at that, is that their capital should be dear and human beings cheap. Hence, if the industry is such as to yield a considerable return, or if one unit in the industry, owing to some special advantage, produces more cheaply than its neighbours, while selling at the same price, or if a revival of trade raises prices, or if suppHes are controlled by one of the combines which are now the rule in many of the more important industries, the resulting surplus normally passes neither to the managers, nor to the other employees, nor to the public, but to the shareholders.

Such an arrangement is preposterous in the literal sense of being the reverse of that which would be established by considerations of equity and common sense, and gives rise (among other anomalies) to what is called "the struggle between labour and capital." The phrase is apposite, since it is as absurd as the relations of which it is intended to be a description. To deplore "ill-feeling", or to advocate "harmony", between "labour and capital" is as rational as to lament the bitterness between carpenters and hammers or to promote a mission for restoring amity between mankind and its boots. The only significance of these *clichés* is that their repetition tends to muffle their inanity, even to the point of persuading sensible men that capital "employs" labour, much as our pagan ancestors imagined that the pieces of wood and iron, which they deified in their day, sent their crops and won their battles. When men have gone so far as to talk as though their idols have come to life, it is time that some one broke them. Labour consists of persons, capital of things. The only use of things is to be applied to the service of persons. The business of persons is to see that they are there to use, and that no more than need be is paid for using them.

Thus the application to industry of the principle of function involves an alteration of proprietary rights, because those rights do not contribute, as they now are, to the end which industry exists to serve. What gives unity to any activity, what alone can reconcile the conflicting claims of the different groups engaged in it, is the purpose for which it is carried on. If men have no common goal it is no wonder that they should fall out by the way, nor are they likely to be reconciled by a redistribution of their provisions. If they are not content both to be servants, one or the other must be master, and it is idle to suppose that mastership can be held in a state of suspense between the two. There can be a division of functions between different grades of workers, or between worker and consumer, because each, without prejudice to the other, can have in his own sphere the authority needed to enable him to fill it. But there cannot be a division of functions between the worker and the owner who is owner and nothing else, for what function does such an owner perform? The provision of capital? Then pay him the sum needed to secure the use of his capital, but neither pay him more nor admit him to a position of authority over production for which, merely as an owner, he is not qualified. For this reason, while an equilibrium between worker and manager is possible, because both are workers, that which it is sought to establish between workers and owners is not. It is like the offer which the Germans made to negotiate with Belgium from Brussels. Their proposals may be excellent: but it is not evident why they are where they are, or how, since they do not contribute to production, they come to be putting forward proposals at all. As long as they are in territory where they have no business to be, their excellence as individuals will be overlooked in resentment at the system which puts them in a position of authority.

It is fortunate indeed, if nothing worse than this happens. For one way of solving the problem of the conflict of rights in industry is not to base rights on functions, as we propose, but to base them on force. It is to reestablish in some veiled and decorous form the institution of slavery, by making labour compulsory. In nearly all countries a concerted refusal to work has been made at one time or another a criminal offence. There are to-day parts of the British Empire, as well as of the world outside it, in which European capitalists, unchecked by any public opinion or authority independent of themselves, are free to impose almost what terms they please upon workmen of ignorant and helpless races. In those districts of America where capitalism still retains its primitive lawlessness, the same result appears to be produced upon immigrant workmen by the threat of violence.

In such circumstances the conflict of rights which finds expression in industrial warfare does not arise, because the rights of one party have been extinguished. The simplicity of the remedy is so attractive that it is not surprising that the Governments of industrial nations should coquet from time to time with the policy of compulsory arbitration. After all, it is pleaded, it is only analogous to the action of a supernational authority which should use its common force to prevent the outbreak of war. In reality, compulsory arbitration is the opposite of any policy which such an authority could pursue either with justice or with hope of success. For it takes for granted the stability of existing relationships, and intervenes to adjust incidental disputes upon the assumption that their equity is recognized and their permanence desired. In industry, however, the equity of existing relationships is precisely the point at issue. A League of Nations which settled the quarrel between a subject race and its oppressors, between Slavs and Magyars, or the inhabitants of what was once Prussian Poland and the Prussian Government, on the assumption that the subordination of Slav to Magyars and Poles to Prussians was part of an unchangeable order, would rightly be resisted by all those who think liberty more precious than peace. A State which, in the name of peace, should make the concerted cessation of work a legal offence, would be guilty of a similar betrayal of freedom. It would be solving the conflict of rights between those who own and those who work by abolishing the rights of those who work.

## (b) The extinction of the Capitalist

So here again, unless we are prepared to reestablish some form of forced labour, we reach an *impasse*. But it is an *impasse* only in so long as we regard the proprietary rights of those who own the capital used in industry as absolute and an end in themselves. If, instead of assuming that aU property, merely because it is property, is equally sacred, we ask what is the *purpose* for which capital is used, what is its *function*, we shall realize that it is not an end but a means to an end, and that its function is to serve and assist (as the economists tell us) the labour of human beings, not the function of human beings to serve those who happen to own it.

And from this truism two consequences follow. The first is that since capital is a thing, which ought to be used to help industry as a man may use a bicycle to get more quickly to his work, it ought, when it is employed, to be employed on the cheapest terms possible. The second is that those who own it should no more control production than a man who lets a house controls the meals which shall be cooked in the kitchen, or a man who lets a boat the speed at which the rowers shall pull. In other words, capital should always be got at cost price, which means, unless public bodies find it wise, as they very well may, to own the capital used in certain industries, it should be paid the lowest interest for which it can be obtained, but should carry no right either to residuary dividends or to the control of industry.

There are, in theory, six ways by which the control of industry by the agents of private property-owners can be terminated. The owners may be expropriated without compensation. They may voluntarily surrender it. They may be frozen out by action on the part of the working *personnel*, which itself undertakes such functions, if any, as they have performed, and makes them superfluous by conducting production without their assistance. Their place may be taken by associations of consumers which supply themselves, and which vest both the ultimate control and the residuary profits in those who use the service or purchase the goods. Their proprietary interest may be limited or attenuated to such a degree that they become mere *rentiers*, who are guaranteed a fixed payment analogous to that of the debenture-holder, but who receive no profits and bear no responsibility for the organization of industry. They may, finally, be bought out.

The first alternative is exemplified by the historical confiscations of the past, such as, for instance, the seizure of ecclesiastical property by the ruling classes of England, Scotland and most other Protestant states. The second has rarely, if ever, been tried---the nearest approach to it, perhaps, was the famous abdication of August 4th, 1789. The third is the method apparently contemplated by the building guilds which are now in process of formation in Great Britain. The fourth method of treating the capitalist is followed by the co-operative movement. The fifth is that recommended by the committee of employers and trade-unionists in the building industry over which Mr. Foster presided, and which proposed that employers should be paid a fixed salary and a fixed rate of interest on their capital, but that all surplus profits should be pooled and administered by a central body representing employers and workers. The sixth has repeatedly been practised by municipalities, and somewhat less often by national governments.

Which of these alternative methods of removing industry from the control of the property-owner is adopted is a matter of expediency to be decided in each particular case. "Nationalization," therefore, which is sometimes advanced as the only method of extinguishing proprietary rights, is merely one species of a considerable *genus*. It can be used, of course, to produce the desired result. But it is a means to an end, not an end in itself. Properly conceived, its object is not to establish the State management of industry, but to remove the dead hand of private ownership, when the private owner has ceased to perform any positive function. It is unfortunate, therefore, that the abolition of obstructive property rights, which is indispensable, should have been identified with a single formula, which may be applied with advantage in the special circumstances of some industries, but need not necessarily be appHed to all.

While the most elaborate scheme for the administration of a nationalized industry advanced within recent years has come from the Miners' Federation, the clearest example of a practical alternative to nationalization has been supplied by the Building Trades. The Building Industry, which, till a few years ago, was not specially noted for intellectual activity, has produced since the Armistice two plans of reconstruction, neither of which owes anything to traditional discussions of nationalization, but both of which, though in different degrees, involve a complete breach with private ownership as hitherto understood. The first, that of the building guilds, gets rid of the capitalist employer in the simplest possible way. It walks round him. The capital equipment required for building houses is relatively small. Unlike mining or factory industry, there is in building no fixed establishment within which alone operations can be carried on. Since it is largely a localized industry working for a market in its immediate neighbourhood, the productive work of the craftsman is not overshadowed by an elaborate commercial organization. The provision of decent houses has notoriously been the field in which, even before the war, alike in quantity and quality, the failure of capitalist industry was at once most disastrous and least excusable.

The Manchester Building Guild Committee, with the 57 building Committees which have sprung from it in different parts of the country, and the London Guild of Builders have taken advantage of these simple facts, not to expropriate the employer, but to supersede him. As long as each group of workers necessary to the building of a house insists on acting in isolation, a business man may be needed to bring them together. If the whole profession unites, it can serve the public direct, without his mediation. The aim of the guilds is not profit, but the provision of good houses at a reasonable price, on terms compatible with the dignity of the workers. Their argument is that these two things are really one, that the system which treats the craftsman as a "hand" is the same as that which crowds families into tenements, and that the latter will be properly housed only by the same associated effort as makes the former a master in his own profession.

Hence the guilds are organized, not, like a trade union, for the defence of economic rights, but for the discharge of professional duties They do not aim at making a large surplus out of the difference between prices and costs: indeed, it is a fundamental rule of the London Guild of Builders that the surplus earnings cannot be distributed as dividends, but must be used for the improvement of the service, and a clause to the same effect formed part of the agreement reached in July, 1920, between the Manchester Guild Committee and the Ministry of Health. What they ask is that the body for whom the work is performed shall pay a sum which is sufficient to keep men "on the strength", when, through no fault of their own, there is no work for them to do. The Guild Committee, with the aid of the Cooperative Wholesale Society and the Co-operative Bank, buys its own materials. The Local Authority which gives it a contract pays the prime cost of the work, *plus* an allowance of £40 per house to cover payment for lost time, and of 6% to cover the cost of plant and overhead charges.

Governed by representatives of the building trade unions, together with administrators and technicians, and thus including craftsmen and professional elements in a single organization, the building guild committees command the industry in the areas where they have taken root by commanding its *personnel*. To the Local Authorities, who have been at their wits end to secure houses, they can offer all that is offered by a contractor, and can offer it more effectively, for they secure the services of the *élite* of the profession, and enjoy the enthusiastic support of the trade unions. What they offer to the worker is the end of the odious and degrading system under which he is thrown aside, like unused material, whenever his services do not happen to be required, membership in a self-governing profession, and the consciousness that he is working for the service of his fellows, not to make profit for an employer.

It is too early yet to estimate the degree of practical success which the guilds will achieve. But young as they are, they have already discredited the assumption that it is only the fear of unemployment and the appetite for gain which will induce men to work effectively, for, by general consent of all observers, the standard of zeal, efficiency, and *esprit de corps* shown by workers on contracts undertaken by the guilds is strikingly above what is normal in the industry. Since their future depends entirely upon the inherent merits of the guild organization, its demonstration that it works economically and can give effect to its undertakings, it is difficult to understand why the Ministry of Health, when the shortage of houses is put at anything from 120,000 to 500,000, should have sought to limit their utility by fixing 20 as the maximum number of contracts which it would sanction between the guilds and Local Authorities.

The example set by the building guilds can hardly fail to be of capital importance in all industries, such (for example) as agriculture, where the small capital required makes it possible for a group of workers to offer their services to the public without the intervention of an employer. There is another way, however, of disposing of the private owner, without nationalization, besides that of "freezing him out." It may be called the policy of attenuation. Ownership is not a right, but a bundle of rights, and it is possible to strip them off piecemeal as well as to strike them off simultaneously. The ownership of capital involves, as we have said, three main claims; the right to interest as the price of capital, the right to profits, and the right to control, in virtue of which managers and workers are the servants of shareholders. These rights in their fullest degree are not the invariable accompaniment of ownership, nor need they necessarily co-exist. The ingenuity of financiers long ago devised methods of grading stock in such a way that the ownership of some carries full control, while that of others does not, that some bear all the risk and are entitled to all the profits, while others are limited in respect to both. All are property, but not all carry proprietary rights of the same degree.

Even while the private ownership of industrial capital still remains, it is possible to attenuate its influence by insisting that it shall be paid not more than a rate of interest fixed in advance, and that it shall carry with it no right of control. In such circumstances the position of the ordinary shareholder would approximate to that of the owner of debentures; the property in the industry would be converted into a mortgage on its profits; while the control of its administration and all profits in excess of the minimum would remain to be vested elsewhere.

Such a change in the character of ownership would have three advantages. It would abolish the government of industry by property. It would end the payment of profits to functionless shareholders by turning them into creditors paid a fixed rate of interest. It would lay the foundations for industrial peace by making it possible to convert industry into a profession carried on by all grades of workers for the service of the public, not for the gain of those who own capital. The organization which it would produce will be described, of course, as impracticable. It is interesting, therefore, to find it is that which experience has led practical men to suggest as a remedy for the disorders of one of the most important of national industries, that of building.

The question before the Committee of employers and workmen, which issued in August, 1919, a Report upon the Building Trade, was "Scientific Management and the Reduction of Costs."[^1] These are not phrases which suggest an economic revolution; but it is something little short of a revolution that the signatories of the report propose. For, as soon as they came to grips with the problem, they found that it was impossible to handle it effectively without reconstituting the general fabric of industrial relationships which is its setting. Why is the service supplied by the industry ineffective? Partly because the workers do not give their full energies to the performance of their part in production. Why do they not give their best energies? Because of "the fear of unemployment, the disinclination of the operatives to make unlimited profit for private employers, the lack of interest evinced by operatives owing to their nonparticipation in control, inefficiency both managerial and operative." How are these psychological obstacles to efficiency to be counteracted? By increased supervision and speeding up, by the allurements of a premium bonus system, or the other devices by which men who are too ingenious to have imagination or moral insight would bully or cajole poor human nature into doing what---if only the systems they invent would let it!---it desires to do, simple duties and honest work? Not at all. By turning the building of houses into what teaching now is, and what Mr. Squeers thought it could never be, an honourable profession.

[^1]: Reprinted in *The Industrial Council for the Building Industry.*

"We believe," they write, "that the great task of our Industrial Council is to develop an entirely new system of industrial control by the members of the industry itself---the actual producers, whether by hand or brain---and to bring them into co-operation with the State as the central representative of the community whom they are organized to serve." Instead of unlimited profits, so "indispensable as an incentive to efficiency," the employer is to be paid a salary for his services as manager, and a rate of interest on his capital which is to be both fixed and (unless he fails to earn it through his own inefficiency) guaranteed; anything in excess of it, any "profits" in fact, which in other industries are distributed as dividends to shareholders, he is to surrender to a central fund to be administered by employers and workmen for the benefit of the industry as a whole. Instead of the financial standing of each firm being treated as an inscrutable mystery to the public, with the result that it is sometimes a mystery to itself, there is to be a system of public costing and audit, on the basis of which the industry will assume a collective liability for those firms which are shown to be competently managed. Instead of the workers being dismissed in slack times to struggle along as best they can, they are to be maintained from a fund raised by a levy on employers and administered by the trade unions.

Thus there is to be publicity as to costs and profits, open dealing and honest work and mutual helpfulness, instead of the competition which the nineteenth century regarded as an efficient substitute for them. "Capital" is not to "employ labour." Labour, which includes managerial labour, is to employ capital; and to employ it at the cheapest rate at which, in the circumstances of the trade, it can be got. If it employs it so successfully that there is a surplus when it has been fairly paid for its own services, then that surplus is not to be divided among shareholders, for, when they have been paid interest, they have been paid their due; it is to be used to equip the industry to provide still more effective service in the future.

So here we have the majority of a body of practical men, who care nothing for socialist theories, proposing to establish "organized Public Service in the Building Industry," recommending, in short, that their industry shall be turned into a profession. And they do it, it will be observed, by just that functional organization, just that conversion of full proprietary rights into a mortgage secured (as far as efficient firms are concerned) on the industry as a whole, just that transference of the control of production from the owner of capital to those whose business is production, which, as we said, is necessary if industry is to be organized for the performance of service, not for the pecuniary advantage of those who hold proprietary rights. The objection commonly made to such proposals for a limitation of profits as were advanced by the Building Trade Committee is that exceptional gains and exceptional losses must be set against each other, that, on the average, profits are not more than sufficient to evoke the supply of new capital needed, and that it is only the possibility of large gains which secures investment in speculative undertakings. The risks of industry, however, are of various kinds; broadly speaking, they belong to one of three main types. There are, in the first place, what may be called "natural risks," which arise from causes altogether outside the control of the individuals or groups affected by them, such as a drought in Australia or America which sends up the price of wool or cotton, a famine in China or India which destroys a market, a storm at sea or a European war. There are, in the second place, the risks of experiment or of economic progress, which are incidental to the development of an industry, such as expenditure upon costly investigations, experiments or new processes, of which many must fail in order that one may succeed, or the attempt to establish a connection with some new source of supply of raw material or some newmarket for the product.

In the third place, there are risks incidental to competitive industry, which are due partly to the possibility that one firm may be undersold by another, partly, and that in a more important measure, to the fact that, as long as each undertaking is operated as an independent unit, the security of each is obviously less than the security of the industry as a whole. Clearly, the larger the unit of organization, the less, other things being equal, are the risks. A coal mine is a highly speculative investment, for even the most skilful management, aided by the most expert scientific advice, is liable to be baffled by unsuspected difficulties, such as faults and water. The coal industry of a single district is much less speculative, but even it, if, for example, it is mainly an export district, may lose a market abroad. The coal industry as a whole, until some other source of power replaces coal, is speculative only to a very slight extent indeed.

Of these three types of risk the two first are, in one form or another, a necessary charge which cannot be avoided. Some "natural" risks may be, and are, made the subject of insurance. The "risks of experiment" must obviously be incurred unless industry is to stagnate, and must be met by setting adequate funds aside for economic expansion. Both, on a long view, are part of the cost of production, and as costs they should be treated. To say that profits are the payments for risks of this kind is to claim, in effect, that they are Trust funds and are earmarked to meet special liabilities. But then, if they are Trust funds, they must be used as Trust funds, and must not be liable to be raided, as now, for the payments of dividends. The sum to be set aside to meet these risks should not be decided by the owners of capital or their agents---for no man is fit to be judge in his own cause---but by a joint body on which the workers, the consumers and the State would be adequately represented. It should, in short, be removed from the vague and indeterminate area, of which, under the name of "profits," the owner of capital claims to dispose as he pleases, and should be reduced to terms sufficiently definite for discussion and criticism.

It is obvious, however, that "competitive risks" are in a different category. They are not due to "the act of God," nor are they the price of economic progress. They arise primarily from the manner in which industry is organized, and diminish or increase as that organization changes. They are normally at their greatest when competition is perfectly free; they are normally diminished when free competition is replaced by some kind of agreement. No intelligent judgment can be passed on the statement that profits are the payment for risk-taking and that the speculative character of industry makes a fixed rate of interest on capital impracticable, until it is known in precisely what category the risks in question fall. If it is plain that such risks as are inevitable must be borne, it is no less evident that no justification for high profits is offered by the existence of such risks as are not. Risks which are avoidable ought not, in short, to be paid for; they ought to be avoided. The speculative element in industry cannot be altogether eliminated. But to claim that the payment to capital should be increased merely because its owners have chosen to organize industry in a way which makes it unnecessarily speculative, is irrational. It is like proposing that a general should be decorated merely because, when the opportunity of a comparatively bloodless victory was open to him, he adopted an order of battle which resulted in numerous casualties.

Moreover, the present tendency of industrial organization, as compared with that of the period from 1800 to 1880, is to diminish what have been called the "competitive risks" of industry by bringing competition under control, and, sometimes, by eliminating it altogether. A whole chapter, indeed, of recent economic history is concerned with the attempts of the business world to lighten risks by mutual arrangements, varying from "gentlemen's agreements" for the stabilization of prices, through one form or another of cartel, to the complete amalgamation of formerly independent businesses. When a really effective combination is established, it is evident that the security of business is greatly increased, since one whole order of risks is eliminated altogether. The possibility of over-production followed by reckless price-cutting is removed. More important, the credit of the different plants in the industry becomes that of the whole.

In such circumstances the objection that the speculative character of industry makes it impossible to restrict the payment made to the owner of capital to a fixed rate of interest loses most of its weight, since the risks which are the conventional justification for high dividends have very largely disappeared. The capitalist may plausibly argue that an individual cotton mill, or soap factory, or coal mine is a speculation in which only the prospect of large profits would induce him to invest; but he cannot say the same about Coats' Sewing-thread Combine, Lord Leverhulme's Soap Trust, or the coal industry when it is treated as a financial unit. By his own admission, when separate firms are merged in a single combination, profits ought not, as is normally the case, to be increased. Since the security offered is better, they ought to be diminished.

The question raised by the Report of the Building Trade Committee is whether industry cannot be so organized, even under private ownership, that capital may be paid a stipulated rate, and that residuary profits, when they arise, may pass to the worker and the consumer. Its suggestion is, in effect, that, instead of the earnings of capital being treated as an undifferentiated block, of which the directors of an enterprise can dispose as they please, a clear discrimination should be made between the payment needed to secure the necessary supplies of capital, the reserves required to meet risks, the salary of the employer as manager, and such surplus, if any, as may arise. In industries which are, in effect, monopolies, the difficulty does not appear to be great. The State already prescribes the sliding scale in accordance with which the dividends of Gas Companies must be paid, and controls---a necessary corollary---the issue of new capital. There does not appear to be any insuperable objection to making the adoption of a similar arrangement a condition precedent to the sanctioning of combination in other industries. Were that course pursued, the firms concerned would pay the market rate of interest, but no more; and the surplus profits now received by shareholders in (for example) Coats' Combine, would be returned to the consumer in lower prices and to the worker in improved conditions.

In industries which are not controlled by a combination, an alternative course is suggested by the proposal of the Building Trade Committee that the trade should combine so far as is needed to place a financial guarantee behind those firms which satisfy a body representing the whole trade that they are competently managed. When even this degree of united action is impossible, there would remain the proposal that firms should be required, before they distribute any dividends, to set aside a prescribed sum (equal, for example, to a certain proportion of their paid-up capital) as reserves to meet risks, and that, when that sum had been provided, the maximum percentage to be paid to shareholders should be fixed by a Public Authority, and issues of new capital made only with its sanction.

Whether such proposals are adopted or not, the Building Trades Committee are undoubtedly right in thinking that it is no longer sufficient to defend profits in general terms by the statement that there is a "rough correspondence" between profits and risks. A rough correspondence, when it exists, is not sufficient. The argument that business is a lottery, and that profits and losses cancel each other, is not likely to be accepted, until it is proved beyond doubt that it is impossible for the productive work of the world to be organized upon methods more dignified and rational than those of the gambling saloon, from the analogy of which such double-edged arguments appear often to be drawn.

The present position of the capitalist employer resembles, it may be suggested, that of a king in the days when no clear distinction was made between the personal and the official revenue of the monarchy. The result of that situation is a matter of history. Kings (like employers) were not worse than other men. But they spent on themselves money which they should have spent on the business of the nation. Parliaments (like trade unions) were not more short-sighted than other bodies. But they cut down the revenue available for public necessities, in order to prevent it being wasted on private luxuries. And the efficiency of the public services suffered from both alike, as the efficiency of industry suffers to-day. The remedy discovered after some centuries of struggle was to make a sharp division between the personal and the official revenue of the monarch by the establishment of a Civil List.

To put himself upon a "Civil List" would be the course of wisdom for the private employer who desires, not merely to cling to every tittle of his power, but to adapt his position to a new situation. In the circumstances of the moment, a policy of prudent conservatism would have as its object, it may be suggested, to narrow the area of contentious twilight which at present surrounds the financial operations of industry. It would make a point of placing all figures as to costs and profits on the table. It would discriminate sharply between interest and profits, and would prove that no higher payment was made to capital than was necessary, in the conditions of the market, to obtain its services. It would aim, in short, both at converting the capitalist into a *rentier* and at striking an alliance between managerial and other kinds of labour, which would be strong enough to put pressure upon him.

Compared, however, either with the programme of the Building Guilds or with Public Ownership, this proposal to retain the private employer, while limiting his functions and converting him from a profit-maker into a manager has, with all its attractions, certain obvious disadvantages. For one thing, the real capital of a business is often almost undiscoverable. For another thing, the course suggested is open to the objection that it circumscribes the authority which at present directs industry, without, like either of the alternative proposals, providing an effective substitute for it. Had the movement against the control of production by property taken place before the rise of limited companies, in which ownership is separated from management, the transition to the organization of industry as a profession might also have taken place, as the employers and workmen in the building trade propose that it should, by limiting the rights of private ownership without abolishing it. But that is not what has actually happened, and therefore the proposals of the building trade are not capable of general application. It may be possible to retain private ownership in building and in industries like building, while changing its character, precisely because in building the employer is normally not merely an owner, but something else as well. He is a manager; that is, he is a workman. And because he is a workman, whose interests, and still more whose professional spirit as a workman may often outweigh his interests and merely financial spirit as an owner, he can form part of the productive organization of the industry, after his rights as an owner have been trimmed and limited.

But that dual position is abnormal, and in the highly organized industries is becoming more abnormal every year. In coal, in cotton, in shipbuilding, in many branches of engineering the owner of capital is not, as he is in building, an organizer or manager. His connection with the industry and his interest in it is purely financial. He is an owner and nothing more. And because his interest is merely financial, so that his concern is dividends, and production only as a means to dividends, he cannot be worked into an organization of industry which vests administration in a body representing all grades of producers, or producers and consumers together, for he has no purpose in common with them. Joint councils between workers and managers may succeed, but joint councils between workers and owners or agents of owners, like most of the so-called Whitley Councils, will not, because the necessity for the mere owner is itself one of the points in dispute.

The master builder, who owns the capital used, can be included, not *qua* capitalist, but *qua* builder, if he surrenders some of the rights of ownership, as the Building Industry Committee proposed that he should. But if the shareholder in a colliery or a shipyard abdicates the control and unlimited profits to which, *qua* capitalist, he is at present entitled, he abdicates everything that makes him what he is, and has no other standing in the industry. He cannot share like the master builder, in its management, because he has no qualifications which would enable him to do so. His object is profit; and if industry is to become, as employers and workers in the building trade propose, an "organized public service," then its subordination to the shareholders whose object is profit, is, as they clearly see, precisely what must be eliminated. The master builders propose to give it up. They can do so because they have their place in the industry in virtue of their function as workmen. But if the shareholder gave it up, he would have no place at all.

In coal mining, therefore, where ownership and management are sharply separated, the owners will not admit the bare possibility of any system in which the control of the administration of the mines is shared between the management and the miners. "I am authorized to state on behalf of the Mining Association," Lord Gainford, the chief witness on behalf of the mine-owners, informed the Coal Commission, "that if the owners are not to be left complete executive control they will decline to accept the responsibility for carrying on the industry."[^2] So the mine-owners blow away in a sentence the whole body of plausible make-believe which rests on the idea that, while private ownership remains unaltered, industrial harmony can be produced by the magic formula of joint control. And they are right. The representatives of workmen and shareholders, in mining and in other industries, can meet and negotiate and discuss. But joint administration of the shareholders' property by a body representing shareholders and workmen is impossible, because there is no purpose in common between them. For the only purpose which could unite all persons engaged in industry, and overrule their particular and divergent interests, is the provision of service. And the object of shareholders, the whole significance and metier of industry to them, is not the provision of service but the provision of dividends.

## (c) Nationalization as a problem in Constitution-making

Hence in industries where management is divorced from ownership, as in most of the highly organized trades it is to-day, there is no obvious halfway house between the retention of the present system and the complete extrusion of the capitalist from the control of production. The change in the character of ownership, which is necessary in order that coal or textiles and shipbuilding may be organized as professions for the service of the public, cannot easily spring from within. The blow needed to liberate them from the control of the property-owner must come from without.

In theory it might be struck by action on the part of the organized workers, who would abolish residuary profits and the right of control by the mere procedure of refusing to work as long as they were maintained, on the historical analogy offered by peasants who have destroyed predatory property in the past by declining to pay its dues and admit its government, in which case Parliament would intervene only to register the community's assent to the *fait accompli*. Some such result appears to have been the design of the recent action of the Italian workers in seizing the factories. In England, however, the conditions of modern industry being what they are, that course, apart from its other disadvantages, is so unlikely to be attempted, or, if attempted, to succeed, that it can be neglected. The alternative to it is that the change in the character of property should be affected by legislation in virtue of which the rights of ownership in an industry are bought out simultaneously.

In either case, though the procedure is different, the result of the change, once it is accomplished, is the same. Private property in capital, in the sense of the right to profits and control, is abolished. What remains of it is, at most, a mortgage in favour of the previous proprietors, a dead leaf which is preserved, though the sap of industry no longer feeds it, as long as it is not thought worth while to I strike it off. And since the capital needed to maintain and equip a modern industry could not be T provided by any one group of workers, even were it desirable on other grounds that they should step completely into the position of the present owners, the complex of rights which constitutes ownership remains to be shared between them and whatever organ may act on behalf of the general community. The former, for example, may be the heir of the present owners as far as the control of the routine and administration of industry is concerned: the latter may succeed to their right to dispose of residuary profits. The elements composing property, have, in fact, to be disentangled: and the fact that to-day, under the common name of ownership, several different powers are vested in identical hands, must not be allowed to obscure the probability that, once private property in capital has been abolished, it may be expedient to reallocate those powers in detail as well as to transfer them *en bloc*.

The essence of a profession is, as we have suggested, that its members organize themselves for the performance of function. It is essential therefore, if industry is to be professionalized, that the abolition of functionless property should be not interpreted to imply a continuance under public ownership of the absence of responsibility on the part of the *personnel* of industry, which is the normal accompaniment of private ownership working through the wage-system. It is the more important to emphasize that point, because such an implication has sometimes been conveyed in the past by some of those who have presented the case for such a change in the character of ownership as has been urged above.

The name consecrated by custom to the transformation of property by public and external action is Nationalization. But Nationalization is a word which is neither very felicitous nor free from ambiguity. Properly used, it means merely ownership by a body representing the nation---"the nation" considered as the general public of consumers, rather than as the subjects of a particular political allegiance; and when it can be shown that the territorial state is not a suitable organization for the administration of industry, the case for "nationalization," in the sense of public ownership, remains unaltered. It is an unfortunate chance that English speaking peoples employ one word to express what in France and Germany are expressed by two, *étatisation* or *Verstaatlichung* and socialisation or *Sozialisierung*,---words which in those languages, unlike the common English practice, are used, not as synonyms, but as antitheses---and that no language possesses a vocabulary to express neatly the finer shades in the numerous possible varieties of organization under which a public service may be carried on.

The result has been that the singularly colourless word "Nationalization" almost inevitably tends to be charged with a highly specialized and quite arbitrary body of suggestions. It has come in practice to be used as equivalent to a particular method of administration, under which officials employed by the State step into the position of the present directors of industry, and exercise all the power which they exercised. So those who desire to maintain the system under which industry is carried on, not as a profession serving the public, but for the advantage of shareholders, attack nationalization on the ground that state management is necessarily inefficient, and tremble with apprehension whenever they post a letter in a letter-box; and those who desire to change it reply that state services are efficient, and praise God whenever they use a telephone; as though either private or public administration had certain peculiar and unalterable characteristics, instead of depending for its quality, like an army or railway company or school, and all other undertakings, public and private alike, not on whether those who conduct it are private officials or state officials, but on whether they are properly trained for their work and can command the good will and confidence of their subordinates.

The arguments on both sides are ingenious, but in reality nearly all of them are beside the point. The merits of nationalization do not stand or fall with the efficiency or inefficiency of existing state departments as administrators of industry. For nationalization, which means public ownership, does not involve placing industry under the machinery of the political state, with its civil servants controlled, or nominally controlled, by Cabinet Ministers, and is compatible with several different types of management. The constitution of the industry may be "unitary," as is (for example) that of the post-office. Or it may be "federal," as was that designed by Mr. Justice Sankey for the coal industry. Administration may be centralized or decentralized. The authorities to whom it is entrusted may be composed of representatives of the consumers, or of representatives of professional associations, or of state officials, or of all three in several different proportions. Executive work may be placed in the hands of civil servants, trained, recruited, and promoted as in the existing state departments, or a new service may be created with a procedure and standards of its own. The industry may be subject to Treasury control, or it may be financially autonomous. The problem is, in fact, of a familiar, though difficult, order. It is one of constitution making.

It is commonly assumed by controversialists that the organization and management of a nationalized industry must, for some undefined reason, be similar to that of the Post-Office. One might as reasonably suggest that the pattern and exemplar of private enterprise must be the Steel Corporation or the Imperial Tobacco Company. The administrative systems obtaining in a society which has nationalized its foundation industries will, in fact, be as various as in one that resigns them to private ownership; and to discuss their relative advantages, without defining what particular type of each is the subject of reference, is to-day as unhelpful as to approach a modern political problem in terms of the Aristotelian classification of constitutions.

The highly abstract dialectics as to "enterprise," "initiative," "bureaucracy," "red tape," "democratic control," "state management," which fill the press of countries occupied with industrial problems, really belong to the dark ages of economic thought. If the student of these questions would wave aside for a moment the inflammatory images of hide-bound pedantry and irresponsible caprice which such phrases evoke, and would consider dispassionately the various types of organization I adopted or suggested, which alone matter in practice, he might be less confident as to the merits or demerits of public ownership in general, but he would be in a better position to pronounce an opinion upon some particular examples of it. He would discover that the varieties of administrative and managerial system applied to public services have been at least as numerous as the undertakings which have been "nationalized," and considerably more numerous than the societies which have "nationalized" them.

Apart from differences in the area over which the service is supplied, in the degree of centralization with which it is administered, and in relations to private business ranging from competition on equal terms to complete monopoly, the management of pubHc undertakings may belong to one of several types. The practice of Great Britain, as exemplified by the Post Office, by Woolwich Arsenal and by the National Dockyards, has been to apply to the control of industry the same type of organization as to those Departments, such as the Home Office, which are not concerned with production. Administration is committed to civil servants under a ministerial head with a seat in the Cabinet, and the efficiency of the service is supposed to be maintained by the Minister's liability to Parliamentary criticism.

This system has developed, not as the result of any deliberate decision as to its merits, but through the extension to reproductive undertakings of precedents derived from services of another kind. A constitution of such a type, based on political analogies, is not the only constitution possible, nor is it even the commonest; and if it is desired to discover some substitute for it, several alternatives are already in existence. In Australia, and, since the nationalization of certain of its great railways, in Canada, the State Railways are administered by Boards of Commissioners who are practically irremovable during their term of office, and the permanent commission is a favourite device in American Cities. The constitution adopted for the British Liquor Control Board vested authority in the hands of a body composed of representatives of certain great Departments, of labour organizations and of employers, with an admixture of experts. The bodies administering the public undertakings of British Local Authorities consist usually of Committees of elected Councillors. But public docks and harbours are controlled by bodies representing the users of the service. The Port of London Authority set up by the Act of 1908 (which has a very bad constitution) consists, in addition to a Chairman and Vice-Chairman, of 18 members elected, on an elaborate system of plural voting based on property, by payers of dues, wharfingers and owners of river craft, and of 10 appointed members, of whom two must be representatives of labour. The London Water Board, which replaced the London Water Companies, and which administers a capital of some £49,000,000 and supplies water to a population of about 7,000,000 persons, is composed under the Act of 1902 of 66 members appointed. by the Local Authorities of the areas served.

Normally it appears to be held that the consumers are adequately protected by the criticism which is supposed to come from a representative body, whether Parliament or a Municipal Council. But sometimes, as in connection with the Ministry of Food, special machinery for expressing their demands and criticisms has been established. The miners proposed that, if the mines were transferred to public ownership, in addition to the representation given the consumer on the District Mining Councils and the National Mining Council, a permanent Fuel Consumer's Council should be set up, representing users of household and industrial coal, which would have the right to call for full information, to press, when it thought fit, for changes of method and policy, and to meet in joint session the body administering the industry. In view of the complete helplessness of the ordinary householder when confronted with a rise of price hitherto, and of the well-known fact that collieries and distributors took advantage of every cold snap or threatened dispute to raise prices against him, there is something cynically comic in the suggestion that he has anything but an immense increase in influence and in power of self-protection to gain from public ownership accompanied by such a scheme of administration as was advanced by the miners and by Mr. Justice Sankey.

It may be remarked in parenthesis, indeed, that the view commonly expressed by the business world, that a public service is likely to ride roughshod over the consumer, appears to be the precise opposite of the truth. The real danger is lest it should be too pliable, and should sacrifice the permanent interests of the service to the demand for immediate cheapness. The instantaneous outcry against "inefficiency," "waste" and "bureaucratic tyranny," by which the proposal to increase the charges made by a nationalized service is met, is in itself the very best evidence of the protection to the consumer which is offered by PubHc Ownership. In private industry the prices of clothes, boots, food and a dozen other commodities rose by over 160% between 1914 and 1921, and no one did more than utter an occasional grumble. But the proposal of the Post Office to raise telephone charges evoked in the business world a storm of indignation. As the users of underground and suburban railways know to their cost, certain Railway Companies habitually sell non-existent places in third-class carriages, and if, much against his will, the unfortunate traveller enters a carriage of another class, proceed to collect from him the excess fare to which the inadequacy of their arrangements have made him liable. If the railways were nationalized the Press would ring with protests against State incompetence and the sharp practice of officials. Since they are in private hands, not a murmur is heard. The explanation is simple. The policy of a public undertaking can be modified by criticism, that of a private business cannot. The former is held to be acting improperly if it squeezes the consumer; the latter would often be regarded as highly eccentric if it did anything else.

Not only may the composition of the controlling body, and its relations to the users of the service, vary enormously, but its relations to its employees may be even more diverse. It may treat all of them as established "Civil Servants," or it may so treat none of them. It may, as the British Ministry of Transport has proposed, and as the French, Swiss and Italian State Railway Administrations have done, give the workers direct representation on the Authorities governing the industry, or it may treat them as "hands" even to the fullest extent demanded by the British Railway Companies. The fact that they are public servants may make no difference to their civil rights; or, as in Prussia before 1914, they may be dismissed if they join a union. They may be allowed to join a union, but they may be told, like the shipyards employees of the British Admiralty, that they are not allowed to strike, or like the Postal Servants, that they must not criticize the administration of the service. Finally, an attempt may be made, as at one time in Australia, to neutralize the political influence which they are supposed to wield, by creating a special constituency for them.

Such are a few of the varieties of organization which lie on the surface. When one turns from them to consider the proposals advanced, they are found to be almost inexhaustible. The attempt to apply a single standard of criticism, based on the mere word Nationalization, to the administration of Prussian coal mines before 1914, the four different reports of the two recent German coal commissions, the programmes of Mr. Justice Sankey and of the Miners' Federation and the half dozen different plans of administration brought before the British Coal Commission, to the American "Plumb plan," the proposals of the British Railway Nationalization Council, and the fifty odd programmes of public ownership which are afoot, frequently with official sanction, in the near East, is merely unintelligent. It is like supposing that France and America are governed in the same way merely because they are both called Republics, or that down to 191 8 Prussia had the same constitution as England because it was called a monarchy.

It is noticeable, indeed, that the chief characteristic of almost all recent programmes of nationalization has been the insistence that the administration of a nationalized industry should not, except when unavoidable, be entrusted to the ordinary machinery of the political state. In Great Britain, France, Germany, Italy, and the British Dominions---to go no further afield---there appears to be general agreement among all contemporary supporters of the policy of public ownership that, though the State must intervene to carry out the *act* of expropriation by due process of law, the *administrative body* which *succeeds* the private proprietor must not be a department directly dependent on the Government of the day, but an authority representing at least those who supply the service and those who use it, and acting with as much elasticity as it is possible for any large scale organization, whether public or private, to achieve. Whether that conclusion---which, be it observed, is the precise opposite of the views usually ascribed to advocates of nationalization by their critics---is accepted or not, serious discussion of the future of industry, as distinct from mere polemics, will not progress until it is recognised that the problem is one of making a constitution, and that in making a constitution, words, so long as they are not outrageous, are less important than facts. The fact is that public ownership, like private enterprise, may be accompanied by any one of a dozen different systems of organization, and that its effect, good or bad, will depend, not upon the name used to describe it, but upon which particular system of organization is adopted in any given case.

The first task of the student, whatever his personal conclusions, is, it may be suggested, to contribute what he can to the restoration of sanity by insisting that instead of the argument being conducted with the counters of a highly inflated and rapidly depreciating verbal currency, the exact situation, in so far as is possible, shall be stated as it is; uncertainties (of which there are many) shall be treated as uncertain, and the precise meaning of alternative proposals shall be strictly defined. Not the least of the merits of Mr. Justice Sankey's report was that, by stating in great detail the type of organization which he recommended for the Coal Industry, he imparted a new precision and reality into the whole discussion. Whether his conclusions are accepted or rejected, it is from the basis of clearly defined proposals such as his that the future discussion of these problems must proceed. It may not find a solution. It will at least do something to create the temper in which alone a reasonable solution can be sought.

Nationalization, then, is not an end, but a means to an end, and when the question of ownership has been settled the question of administration remains for solution. As a means it is likely to be indispensable in those industries in which the rights of private proprietors cannot easily be modified without the action of the State, just as the purchase of land by county councils is a necessary step to the establishment of small holders, when landowners will not voluntarily part with their property for the purpose. But the object in purchasing land is to establish small holders, not to set up farms administered by state officials; and the object of nationalizing mining or railways or the manufacture of steel should not be to establish any particular form of state management, but to release those who do constructive work from the control of those whose sole interest is pecuniary gain, in order that they may be free to apply their energies to the true purpose of industry, which is the provision of service, not the provision of dividends.

When the transference of property has taken place, it will probably be found that the necessary provision for the government of industry will involve not merely the freedom of the producers to produce, but the creation of machinery through which the consumer, for whom he produces, can express his wishes and criticize the way in which they are met, as at present he normally cannot. But that is the second stage in the process of reorganizing industry for the performance of function, not the first. The first is to free it from its present subordination to the pecuniary interests of the owner of property, because they are the magnetic pole which sets all the compasses wrong, and which causes industry, however swiftly it may progress, to progress in the wrong direction.

Nor does this change in the character of property involve a breach with the existing order so sharp as to be impracticable. The phraseology of political controversy continues to reproduce the conventional antitheses of the early nineteenth century; "private enterprise" and "public ownership" are still' contrasted with each other as light with darkness or darkness with light. But, in reality, behind the formal shell of the traditional legal system, the elements of a new body of relationships have already been prepared, and find piecemeal application through policies devised, not by socialists, but by men who repeat the formulae of individualism, at the very moment when they are undermining it. The Esch-Cummins Act in America, the Act establishing a Ministry of Transport in England, Sir Arthur Duckham's scheme for the organization of the coal mines, the proposals with regard to the coal industry advanced at one time by the British Government itself, appear to have the common characteristic of retaining private ownership in name, while attenuating it in fact, by placing its operations under the supervision, accompanied sometimes by a financial guarantee, of a public authority.

Schemes of this general character appear, indeed, to be the first instinctive reaction produced by the discovery that private enterprise is no longer functioning effectively. It is probable that they possess certain merits of a technical order, analogous to those associated with the amalgamation of competing forms into a single combination. It is questionable, however, whether the compromise which they represent is permanently tenable. What, after all, it may be asked, are the advantages of private ownership when it has been pared down to the point which policies of this order propose? May not the "owner," whose rights they are designed to protect, not unreasonably reply to their authors, "Thank you for nothing"? Individual enterprise has its merits: so also, perhaps, has public ownership. But, by the time these schemes have done with it, not much remains of "the simple and obvious system of natural liberty," while their inventors are precluded from appealing to the motives which are emphasized by advocates of nationalization. It is one thing to be an entrepreneur with a world of adventure and unlimited profits---if they can be achieved---before one. It is quite another to be a director of a railway company or coal corporation with a minimum rate of profit guaranteed by the State, and a maximum rate of profit which cannot be exceeded. Hybrids are apt to be sterile. It may be questioned whether, in drawing the teeth of private capitalism, this type of compromise does not draw out most of its virtues as well.

So, when a certain stage of economic development has been reached, private ownership, by the admission of its defenders, can no longer be tolerated in the only form in which it is free to display the characteristic, and quite genuine, advantages for the sake of which it used to be defended. And, as step by step it is whittled down by tacit concessions to the practical necessity of protecting the consumer, or eliminating waste, or meeting the claims of the workers, public ownership becomes, not only on social grounds, but for reasons of economic efficiency, the alternative to a type of private ownership which appears to carry with it few of the rights which are normally valued in ownership and to be singularly devoid of privacy.

It would be a mistake to visualize the displacement of the private capitalist from his position of economic sovereignty as taking place only through the process of nationalization. Over a considerable field of industry the Co-operative Movement has already substituted the motive of communal service for that of profit, and supplies annually to its members, through bodies representing the consumers, goods to the value of some hundred million pounds. It has found a genuine and practicable alternative to the conduct of industry by the agents of shareholders for the pecuniary gain of shareholders, and has thus established the first condition without whi^h an effective partnership between producer and consumer is impossible. The extension of State ownership will take place, it may be suggested, without in any way impinging on the activities of the Co-operative Movement, or on the experiments in "industrial self-government" such as are now being made in the building industry. Its special sphere will be the great foundation industries, which, so far, have set at defiance the one movement and the other.

Inevitably and unfortunately the change must be gradual. But it should be continuous. When, as in the last few years, the State has acquired the ownership of great masses of industrial capital, it should retain it, instead of surrendering it to private capitalists, who protest at once that it will be managed so inefficiently that it will not pay and managed so efficiently that it will undersell them. When estates are being broken up and sold, as they are at present, public bodies should enter the market and acquire them.

Most important of all, the ridiculous barrier which at present prevents English Local Authorities from acquiring property in land and industrial capital, except for purposes specified by Act of Parliament, should be abolished, and they should be free to undertake such services, including (in so far as it is not already covered by Co-operation) the whole field of retail distribution, as their citizens may desire. According to the theory upon which the Local Government of Great Britain is at present based, Local Authorities, from the tiniest Parish Council to the largest County Borough, can exercise only the powers specially conferred on them by Parliament, and, if they desire additional powers, they can obtain them only by the cumbrous and expensive process of private bill legislation. This strict limitation of the sphere of Local Authorities dates from the Municipal Corporations Act of 1835, which was admirable in its reconstruction of the machinery of municipal government, but which was passed at a time when almost the only proper functions of local bodies were conceived to be the preservation of public order and the administration of local finances.

In an age when Municipal Corporations were corrupt oligarchies, the main object of reformers was, not to increase their powers, but to diminish their abuses. But there is no analogy between modern municipalities and the strongholds of incompetence and privilege which were reformed eighty years ago. So far, at least, as County Boroughs are concerned, the right principle is that, instead of their being allowed to do only what they are expressly empowered to do, they should be free to do anything which they are not forbidden to do. Central control is necessary, in order to ensure that posterity is not burdened by excessive capital expenditure, to preserve a minimum standard of efficiency, and to adjust the claims of conflicting authorities. But, provided these conditions are satisfied, there is no reason why great Municipal Corporations should not undertake such services as they may from time to time deem expedient. The objection to public ownership, in so far as it is intelligent, is in reality largely an objection to over-centralization. But the remedy for over-centralization is not the maintenance of functionless property in private hands, but the decentralized ownership of public property. When Birmingham and Manchester and Leeds are the little republics which they should be, there is no reason to anticipate that they will tremble at a whisper from Whitehall.

These things should be done steadily and continuously, quite apart from the special cases like that of the mines, railways, and canals, where the private ownership of capital is stated by the experts to have been responsible for intolerable waste, or the manufacture of armaments and alcoholic liquor, which are politically and socially too dangerous to be left in private hands. They should be done not in order to establish a single form of bureaucratic management, but in order to release industry from the domination of proprietary interests, which, whatever the form of management, are not merely troublesome in detail but vicious in principle, because they divert it from the performance of function to the acquisition of gain. If at the same time private ownership is shaken, as recently it has been, by action on the part of particular groups of workers, so much the better. There are more ways of killing a cat than drowning it in cream, and it is all the more likely to choose the cream if they are explained to it. But the two methods are complementary, not alternative, and the attempt to found rival schools on an imaginary incompatibility between them is a bad case of the *odium sociologicum* which afflicts reformers.
