APPENDIX. A,---French Imports. 

About one-tenth part of the cereals consumed in France is still imported; but, as will be seen in a subsequent chapter, the progress in agriculture has lately been so rapid that even without Algeria France will soon have a surplus of cereals. Wine is imported, but nearly as much is exported. So that coffee and oil seeds remain the only food articles of durable importance for import. For coal and coke France is still tributary to Belgium and this country; but it is chiefly the inferiority of organisation of coal extraction which stands in the way of the home supply. The other important items of imports are: raw cotton (about ^8,000,000 of net imports), raw wool to the same amount, and raw silk (about ;^5, 000,000), as well as hides and furs. The exports of manufactured goods were;^8o,ooo,ooo in 1890 and about ;^7 4,000,000 in subsequent years. Exports of textiles, exclusive of yarn and linen,;^29, 800,000 in 1890, and ^^25, 500,000 in 1891-4. Imports of all textiles,;£6, 900,000 in 1890, and ^4,800,000 in 1891-4.

APPENDIX. 223 

D.---Machinery in Germany. 

The growth of the productive powers in Germany is best illustrated by the development of machinery. In the year 1879 Prussia had 29,985 standing engines (887,780 horsepower), 5442 moving engines (47,100 horse-power), and 625 engines on ships (50,310 horse-power). Total, 35,960 engines (985,190 horse-power). Fifteen years later the respective figures were:---57,224 standing (2,172,250 horsepower), 14,425 moving (147,130 horse-power), and 1726 on ships (219,770 horse-power). Total, 73,375 engines (2,539,150 horse-power). 

Same increase in Bavaria. In 1879, 241 1 standing engines (70,680 horse-power), 892 moving (5520 horse-power), and 98 on ships (2860 horse-power). Total, 3401 engines (79,060 horse-power). In 1889 there were 3819 standing engines (124,680 horse-power), 2021 moving (13,730 horse-power), and 38 on ships (4370 horse-power). Total, 5868 engines (142,750 horse-power). 

For the German Empire Prof. Lexis estimated the total of all engines in 1879 at 65,170 engines, 4,510,640 horsepower. In 1892 the aggregate horse-power was 7,200,000, namely, 2,500,000 horse-power in standing engines, 4,200,000 in moving, and 500,000 on ships (Schmoller's Jahrbuch, xix., i-, P275). 

The rapid progress in the fabrication of machinery in Germany is still better seen from the growth of the German exports as shown by the following table:---

i8go. 1895. 

Machines and parts thereof . .;^2,45o,ooo;^3,2i5,ooo 

Sewing-machines and parts thereof . 315,000 430,000 

Locomotives and locomobiles • . • 280,000 420,000 

Every one knows that part of the German sewing-machines and a considerable amount of tools find their way even into this country, and that German tools are plainly recommended in English books.

E.---Cotton Industry in Germany. 

Dr. G. Schulze-Gaewemitz, in his excellent work, The Cotton Trade in England and on the Continent (English translation by Oscar S. Hall, London, 1895), calls attention to the fact that Germany has certainly not yet attained, in her cotton industry, the high technical level of development attained by England; but he shows also the progress lately realised. The cost of each yard of plain cotton, notwithstanding low wages and long hours, is still greater in Germany than in England, as seen from the following tables. Taking a certain quality of plain cotton in both countries, he gives (p. 151, German edition) the following comparative figures:---

Hours of labour .... 

England. 9 hours 

Germany. 12 hours 

Average weekly earnings of the opera tives 

i6s. 3d. 

IIS. 8d. 

Yards woven per week per operative Cost per yard of cotton 

706 yards o.275d. 

466 yards 0.303d. 

But he remarks also that in all sorts of printed cottons, in which fancy, colours and invention play a predominant part, the advantages are entirely on the side of the smaller German factories. 

In the spinning mills the advantages, on the contrary', continue to remain entirely on the side of England, the number of operatives per 1000 spindles being in various countries as follows (p. 91, English edition):---

Per 1000 spindles. 

Bombay ........ 25 operatives.

Alsace gi 

Mulhouse ........ 7^

1882 8 to 9 

England, 1837 7 

1887 3 

For the last ten years considerable improvements have taken place. " India shows us, since 1884, extraordinary developments," Schulze-Gaewernitz remarks, and " there is no doubt that Germany also has reduced the number of 

APPENDIX. 

225 

operatives per 1000 spindles since the last Inquest ". " From a great quantity of materials lying before me, I cull," he writes, " the following, which, however, refer solely to leading and technically distinguished spinning mills:---

Per 1000 spindles. 6.2 operatives. 5-8 6.2 6.8 7.2 8.9 16.6

F.---Mining and Textiles in Austria. 

To give an idea of the development of industries in Austria-Hungary, it is sufficient to mention the growth of her mining industries and the present state of her textUe industries. 

The value of the yearly extraction of coal and iron ore appears as follows:---

1,281,300 2,837,400 

. 1,749,000 3,015,800 

At the present time the exports of coal entirely balance theimports. 

As to the textile industries, Austria alone, already in 1890,. had 1970 steam-engines, of 113,280 horse-power, employed in 

15

the fabrication of textiles. For cotton spinning she had 153 estabhshments, with 2,392,360 spindles, employing 33,815 work-people, while for cotton weaving she had 194 establishments, with 47,902 power-looms. 

The imports of raw cotton attained, in 1894, the respectable sum of;!{^4j333,ooo (cotton yarn,;£i,375,ooo); of wool, ;^3,ooo,ooo (woollen yarn,;£i,775,ooo); of silk,;^i, 560,000; while her exports of woollen goods quite balanced the imports of the same. 

G.---Mr. Giffen's and Mr. Flux's Figures Concerning THE Position of the United Kingdom in International Trade. 

A few remarks concerning these figures may be of some avail. 

When a sudden fall in the British and Irish exports took place in the years 1882-6, and the alarmists took advantage of the bad times to raise the never-forgotten war-cry of protection, especially insisting on the damages made to British trade by " German competition," Mr. Giflfen analysed the figures of international trade in his " Finance Essays " and in a report read in 1888 before the Board of Trade Commission. Subsequently, Mr. A. W. Flux analysed again the same figures, extending them to a later period. He confirmed Mr. Giffen's conclusions and endeavoured to prove that the famous " German competition " is a fallacy. 

Mr. Giffen's conclusions, quoted by Mr. A. W. Flux (" The Commercial Supremacy of Great Britain," in Economical Journal, 1894, iv., p. 457), were as follows:---

" On the whole, the figures are not such as to indicate any great and overwhelming advance in German exports in comparison with those of the United Kingdom. There is greater progress in certain directions, but, taken altogether, no great disproportionate advance, and in many important markets for the United Kingdom Germany hardly appears at all." 

In this subdued form, with regard to German competition alone---and due allowance being made for figures in which 

APPENDIX. 227 

no consideration is given to what sort of goods make a given value of exports, and in what quantities---Mr. Giffen's statement may be accepted. But that is all. 

If we take, however, Mr. Giffen's figures as they are reproduced in extended tables (on pp. 461-467 of the just quoted paper), tabulated with great pains in order to show that Germany's part in the imports to several European countries, such as Russia, Italy, Servia, etc., has declined, as well as the part of the United Kingdom, all we can conclude from these figures is, that there are other countries besides Germany, namely, the United States and Belgium, which compete very effectively with England, France, and Germany for supplying what manufactured goods are still taken by Russia, Italy, Servia, etc., from abroad. 

At the same time such figures give no idea of the fact that where manufactured metal goods were formerly supplied, coal and raw metals are imported now, for the home manufacture of those same goods; or, where dyed and printed cottons were imported, only yarn is now required. The whole subject is infinitely more complicated than it appears in Mr. Giffen's calculations; and, valuable as his figures may have been for appeasing exaggerated fears, they contain no answer whatever to the many economic questions involved in the matters treated by Mr. Giffen. 

H.---Cotton Manuf.acture in India. 

The views taken in the text about the industrial development of India have been confirmed by a mass of evidence. One of them, coming from authorised quarters, deserves special attention. In an article on the progress of the Indian cotton manufacture, the Textile Recorder (15th October, 1888) wrote:---

" No person connected with the cotton industry can be ignorant of the rapid progress of the cotton manufacture in India. Statistics of all kinds have recently been brought before the public, showing the increase of production in the country; still it does not seem to be clearly understood that this increasing output of cotton goods must seriously lower 

228 FIELDS, FACTORIES AND WORKSHOPS. 

the demand upon Lancashire mills, and that it is not by any means improbable that India may at no vendistant period be no better customer than the United States is now. 

" In former times, Manchester goods were to be found in the most remote villages on the banks of the Ganges and the Brahmaputra, and even in the far distant bazaars of Assam, Sylhet and Cachar. But now," the Recorder wrote, " a change is taking place. Indian cotton piece goods are coming to the front, and displacing those of Manchester. 

" Unbiassed persons having a thorough knowledge of the resources of the country, and having watched the growth of the cotton industry during the last ten years, do not hesitate to say that in a limited period of time the output of all the plainer classes of goods will be sufficient to meet the Indian demand without the supply of goods from Lancashire." 

One hardly need add at what price the Indian manufacturers obtain cheap cottons. The report of the Bombay Factor)Commission which was laid before Parliament in August, 1888, contained facts of such horrible cruelty and cupidity as would hardly be imagined by those who have forgotten the disclosures of the inquirj^ made in this country in 1840-42. The factory engines are at work, as a rule, from 5 A.M. till 7, 8, or 9 P.M., and the workers remain at work for twelve, thirteen, fourteen hours, only releasing one another for meals. In busy times it happens that the same set of workers remain at the gins and presses night and day with half an hour's rest in the evening. In some factories the workers have their meals at the gins, and are so worn out after eight and ten days' uninterrupted work that they supply the gins mechanically " three parts asleep ". 

" It is a sad tale of great want on one side, and cruel cupidity on the other " the official report concludes. However, it would be absolutely erroneous to conclude that Indian manufactures can compete with the British ones as long as they continue the terrible exploitation of human labour which we see now. Forty years ago the British manufactures offered absolutely the same terrible picture of cruel cupidity. But times Avill come when Indian workers will restrain the cupidity of the capitahsts, and the manufactures 

APPENDIX. 229 

of Bombay will be none the worse for that in the competition with the British manufactures. 

I.---Irrigated Meadows in Italy. 

In the Journal de I' Agriculture (2nd Feb., 1889) we find the following about the marcites of Milan:---

" On part of these meadows water runs constantly, on others it is only left running for ten hours every week. The former give six crops every year; since February---80 to 100 tons of grass, equivalent to twenty to twenty-five tons of dry hay, being obtained from the hectare (eight to ten tons per acre). Lower down, thirteen tons of dry hay per acre is the regular crop. Taking eighty acres placed in average conditions, they will yield fifty-six tons of green grass per hectare, that is, fourteen tons of dry hay, or the food of three milch cows to the hectare (two and a half acres). The rent of such meadows is from £^?> to £^() 12s. per acre." 

For Indian corn, the advantages of irrigation are equally apparent. On irrigated lands, crops of from seventy-eight to eighty-nine bushels per acre are obtained, as against from fifty-six to sixty-seven bushels on unirrigated lands, also in Italy, and twenty-eight to thirty-three bushels in France (Garola, Z,es Cereales). 

As to the ways in which agriculture is ruined in Italy we can best see them from the work of Mr. Beauclerck {Rural Italy, London, 1888). Speaking of the Milan province, he remarks that we find there " one of the densest agricultural populations in the world, congregated in a country, of which half is occupied by arid mountains" (416 inhabitants to the square mile). " Flanders alone equals Milan in density of population. The soil is not naturally fertile, and an immense expenditure of capital and labour has alone produced the richness of the land." But " the taxation is fabulously high," as it attains 2620 francs per square kilometre of the cultivated area. Altogether, Mr. Beauclerck considers that rural Italy pays 300,000,000 francs of direct taxes, out of returns not exceeding 1,000,000,000 francs, not to mention the salt tax, the tax on personal property and the indirect taxation.

J.---The Channel Islands. 

The excellent state of agriculture in Jersey and Guernsey has often been referred to in the agricultural and general literature of this countr)', so I need only refer to the works of Mr. W. E. Bear {Journal of the Agricultural Society, 1888; Quarterly Review, 1888; British Farmer, etc.) and to the exhaustive work of D. H. Ansted and R. G. Latham, The Channel Islands, third edition, revised by E. Toulmin Nicolle (London, Allen, 1893). 

Many English writers, certainly not those just named, are inclined to explain the successes obtained in Jersey by the wonderful climate of the islands and the fertility of the soil. As to climate, it is certainly tme that the yearly record of sunshine in Jersey is greater than in any English station. It reaches from 1842 hours a year (1890) to 2300 (1893), and thus exceeds the highest aggregate sunshine recorded in any English station by from 168 to t^t,6 hours (exclusively high maximum in 1894) a year; May and August seeming to be the best favoured months.* But, to quote from the just mentioned work of Ansted and Latham:---

" There is, doubtless, in all the islands, and especially in Guernsey, an absence of sunheat and of the direct action of the suns rays in summer, which must have its effect, and a remarkable prevalence of cold, dry, east wind in late spring, retarding vegetation " (p. 407). Every one who has spent, be it only two or three weeks in late spring in Jersey, must know by experience how true this remark is. Moreover, there are the well-known Guernsey fogs, and " owing also to rain and damp the trees suffer from mildew and blight, as well as from various aphides ". The same authors remark that the nectarine does not succeed in Jersey in the open air " owing to the absence of autumn heat "; that " the wet autumns and cold summ.ers do not agree with the apricot," and so on. 

If Jersey potatoes are, on the average, three weeks in advance of those grown in Cornwall, the fact is fully explained by the continual improvements made in Jersey in view of 

* Ten Years of Sunshine in the British Isles, 1881-1890. 

APPENDIX. 231 

obtaining, be it ever so small, quantities of potatoes a few days in advance, either by special care taken to plant them out as soon as possible, protecting them from the cold winds, or by choosing tiny pieces of land naturally protected or better exposed. The difference in price between the earliest and the later potatoes being immense, the greatest efforts are made to obtain an early crop, and it would seem that the potatoes begin to be grown earlier and earlier, so that three or perhaps even four weeks have been won within the last ten years. 

The following table shows when the exporting season began and what prices were realised per cabot (= ~ of a ton) on the very first day of export:---

As to the fertility of the soil, it is still worse advocacy, because there is no area in the United Kingdom of equal size which would be manured to such an extent as the area of Jersey and Guernsey is by means of artificial manure. In the seventeenth century, as may be seen from the first edition of Falle's Jersey, published in 1694, the island "did not produce that quantity as is necessary for the use of the inhabitants, who must be supplied from England in time of peace, or from Dantzic in Poland ". In The Groans of the Ifthabitants of Jersey, published in London in 1709, we find the same complaint. And Quayle, who wrote in 181 2 and quoted the two works just mentioned, in his turn complained in these terms: " The quantity at this day raised is quite inadequate to their sustenance, apart from the garrison " {General View of the Agriculture and the Present State of the Islands on the Coast of Normandy, London, 1815, p. 77). And he added: "After making all allowance, the truth must be told; the grain crops are here foul, in some instances execrably so ". And when we consult the modern writers, Ansted, Latham and Nicolle, we learn that the soil is by no means rich. It is decomposed granite, and easily cultivable, but " it contains no organic matter besides what man has put into it ". 

This is certainly the opinion any one will come to if he only visits thoroughly the island and looks attentively to its soil---to say nothing of the Quenvais where, in Quayle's time, there was " an Arabian desert " of sands and hillocks covering about seventy acres (p. 24), with a little better but still very poor soil in the north and west of it. The fertility of the soil has entirely been made, first, by the vraic (sea-weeds), upon which the inhabitants have maintained communal rights; later on, by considerable shipments of manure, in addition to the manure of the very considerable living stock which is kept in the island; and finally, by an admirably good cultivation of the soil. 

Much more than sunshine and good soil, it was the conditions of land-tenure, and the low taxation which contributed to the remarkable development of agriculture in Jersey. First of all, the people of the Isles know but little of the 

APPENDIX. 233 

tax-collector. While the English pay, in taxes, an average of 50s. per head of population; while the French peasant is over-burdened with taxes of all imaginable descriptions, and the Milanese peasant has to give to the Treasury full 30 per cent, of his income---all taxes paid in the Channel Islands amount to but los. per head in the town parishes and to much less than that in the country parishes. Besides, •of indirect taxes, none are known but the 2s. 6d. paid for each gallon of imported spirits and gd. per gallon of imported wine. 

As to the conditions of land-tenure, the inhabitants have happily escaped the action of Roman Law, and they continue to live under the coutumier de Normandie (the old Norman common law). Accordingly, more than one-half of the territory is owned by those who themselves till the soil; there is no landlord to watch the crops and to raise the rent before the farmer has ripened the fruit of his improvements; there is nobody to charge so much for each cart-load of sea-weeds or sand taken to the fields; every one takes the amount he likes, provided he cuts the weeds at a certain season of the year, and digs out the sand at a distance of sixty yards from the high-water mark. Those who buy land for cultivation can do so without becoming enslaved to the money-lender. One-fourth part only of the permanent rent which the purchaser undertakes to pay is capitalised and has to be paid down on purchase (often less than that), the remainder being a perpetual rent in wheat which is valued in Jersey at 50 to 54 sons de Fra7ice per cabot. To seize property for debt is accompanied with such difficulties that it is seldom resorted to (Quayle's General View, pp. 41-46). Conveyances of land are simply acknowledged by both parties on oath, and cost nearly nothing. And the laws of inheritance are such as to preserve the homestead notwithstanding the debts that the father may have run into {ibid., pp. 

35-41)

After having shown how small are the farms in the islands (from twenty to five acres, and very many less than that)---there being " less than 100 farms in either island that exceed twenty-five acres; and of these only about half a dozen in 

234 

FIELDS, FACTORIES AND WORKSHOPS. 

Jersey exceed fifty acres "---Messrs. Ansted, Latham and Nicolle remark:---

" In no place do we find so happy and so contented a country as in the Channel Islands. . . ." " The system of land-tenure has also contributed in no small degree to their prosperity. . . ." " The purchaser becomes the absolute owner of the property and his position cannot be touched so long as the interest of these [wheat] rents be paid. He cannot be compelled, as in the case of mortgage, to refund the principal. The advantages of such a system are too patent to need any further allusion." {The Channel Islands, third edition, revised by E. Toulmin Nicolle, p. 401; see also p, 

443-)

The areas under potatoes having been for the last two years respectively 7599 and 7007 acres, the export value per acre attained;^27 6s. in 1893, and;£66 is. in 1894. 

As regards greenhouse culture, a friend of mine, who has worked as a gardener in Jersey, has collected for me various information relative to the productivity of culture under glass. Out of it the following may be taken as a perfectly reliable illustration, in addition to those given in the text:---

Mr. B.'s greenhouse has a length of 300 feet and a width of 18 feet, which makes 5400 square feet, out of which 900 square feet are under the passage in the middle. The cultivable area is thus 4500 square feet. There are no brick walls, but brick pillars and boards are used for front walls. Hot water heating is provided, but is only used occasionally, to keep off the frosts in winter---the crops being early potatoes (which require no heating), followed by tomatoes. The latter are Mr. B.'s speciality. Catch crops of radishes, etc., are taken. The cost of the greenhouse, without the 

2^6 FIELDS, FACTORIES AND WORKSHOPS. 

heating apparatus, is los. per running foot of greenhouse, which makes;^i5o for one-eighth of an acre under glass, or a little less than yd. per glass-roofed square foot. 

The crops are: potatoes, four cabots per perch, i.e., threequarters of a ton of early potatoes from the greenhouse; and tomatoes, in the culture of which Mr. B. attains extraordinary results. He puts in only looo plants, thus giving to his plants more room than is usually given; and he cultivates a corrugated variety which gives very heavy crops but does not fetch the same prices as the smooth varieties. In 1896 his crop was four tons of tomatoes, and so it would have been in 1897---each plant giving an average of twenty pounds of fruit, Avhile the usual crop is from eight to twelve pounds per plant. 

The total crop was thus four and three-quarter tons of vegetables, to which the catch crops must be added---thus corresponding to 85,000 lb. per acre (over 90,000 lb. with the catch crops). I again omit the money returns, and only mention that the expenditure for fuel and manure was, about £^\o a year, and that the Jersey average is three men, each working fifty-five hours a week (ten hours a day), for each acre under glass. 

K.---Planted Wheat. 

The Rothamsted Challenge. 

Sir A. Cotton delivered, in 1893, before the Balloon Society, a lecture on agriculture, in which lecture he warmly advocated deep cultivation and planting the seeds of wheat wide apart. He published it later on as a pamphlet {Lecture on Agriculture, 2nd edition, with Appendix. Dorking, 1893). He obtained, for the best of his sort of wheat, an average of " fifty-five ears per plant, with three oz. of grain of fair quality---perhaps sixty-three lbs. per bushel' (p. 10). This ■corresponded to ninety bushels per acre---that is, his result was very similar to those obtained at the Tomblaine and Capelle agricultural stations by Grandeau and F. Dessprfez, whose work seems not to be known to Sir A. Cotton. True, 

APPENDIX. 237 

Sir A. Cotton's experiments were not conducted, or rather were not reported, in a thoroughly scientific way. But the more desirable it would have been, either to contradict or to confirm his statements by experiments carefully conducted at some experimental agricultural station. This is, in fact, what was expected from the veteran head of the Rothamsted experimental farm. Sir John Lawes, even though the author of the pamphlet may have been hard upon the general lines followed in the Rothamsted experiments. Sir John Lawes took, however, another course, and inserted in the Kcho a letter (reproduced in an Appendix to Sir A. Cotton's lecture), in which we read the following:---

" There are, obviously, two important questions to consider, first---whether so much as from 100 to 120 bushels of wheat can be grown per acre on ordinary arable land? And secondly, whether, if a crop of this magnitude can be grown, it can be done at a cost which will give profit to the farmer? If Sir A. Cotton, or any one else, will grow 1000 bushels on ten acres of fairly average wheat land, spending as much as he likes on the cultivation, I will give him £^2^0. Further, in order to ascertain whether our country can grow sufficient wheat to feed our population, and even, perhaps, for export besides, upon from 2,000,000 to 3,000,000 acres, I will give ;£iooo to Sir A. Cotton, or any one else, who will grow 100 bushels of wheat per acre, on ten separate acres of wheat land, one in each of the ten English counties growing the largest acreage of wheat at the present time; the cost of production being less than the value of the crop, so as to prove that such crops could be grown profitably by our farmers." 

I reprint this letter almost in full (italics are mine) because I have already had letters from correspondents, and seen public affirmations to the effect that Sir John Lawes had offered;^iooo to the person who would grow 100 bushels to the acre, but that no one had answered his challenge. Every one may see now that actually no such challenge has ever been made. 

The fact is this. All Rothamsted experiments were carried on on plots of two-thirds and one-third of an acre. And, from experiments on such a scale, the far-reaching 

238 FIELDS, FACTORIES AND WORKSHOPS. 

conclusion in agriculture as to the limits of profitable manuring was arrived at at Rothamsted. The highest average crop ever attained at Rothamsted on such plots, by any amount of manuring, was thirty-six and a quarter bushels, and the maximum crop obtained in the best season was fifty-six bushels. Now Sir A. Cotton claims that as much as from 80 to 100 bushels to the acre can be obtained by means of deep cultivation and planting wide apart in addition to proper manuring, that is, nearly three times as much as the Rothamsted average was for the best-manured plots. The only fair challenge which could be made with reference to such an assertion would be, in my opinion, to propose to grow an average of 80 or 100 bushels (instead of the Rothamsted thirty-six and a quarter) for several years in succession (bad and good seasons) on plots of the same size as the Rothamsted plots, i.e., one-third and two-thirds of an acre; under the condition, of course, that full account be kept, as it was at Rothamsted, of the manure used and the labour required. But such a challenge was not made, and it was proposed, instead, to grow 1000 bushels on ten acres, in ten different counties, in the second part of the challenge. To make a challenge under such conditions---Sir John Lawes must well know it himself---amounts to no challenge at all. Let us hope, however, that some day the experiments of Hallett, Cotton, Grandeau and Desspr^z will be repeated vit Rothamsted as well, and that Sir John Lawes will give them as brilliant a confirmation as he gave some time ago to Hellriegel's work on nitrification. 

L.---Replanted Wheat. 

A few words on this method which now claims the attention of the experimental stations may perhaps not be useless. 

In Japan, rice is always treated in this way. It is treated as our gardeners treat lettuce and cabbage; that is, it is let first to germinate; then it is sown in special warm corners, well inundated with water and protected from the birds by strings drawn over the ground. Thirty-five to fifty-five days 

APPENDIX. 239 

later, the young plants, now fully developed and possessed of a thick network of rootlets, are replanted in the open ground. In this way the Japanese obtain from twenty to thirty-two bushels of dressed rice to the acre in the poor provinces, forty bushels in the better ones, and from sixty to sixty-seven bushels in the best lands. The average, in six rice growing states of North America, is at the same time only nine and a half bushels.* 

In China, replanting is also in general use, and consequently the idea has been circulated in France by M. Eugene Simon and the late M. Toubeau, that replanted wheat could be made a powerful means of increasing the crops in Western Europe. t So far as I know, the idea has not yet been submitted to a practical test; but when one thinks of the remarkable results obtained by Hallett's method of planting; of what the market gardeners obtain by replanting once and even twice; and of how rapidly the work of planting is done by market gardeners in Jersey, one must agree that in replanted wheat we have a new opening worthy of the most careful consideration. Experiments have not yet been made in this direction; but Prof. Grandeau, whose opinion I have asked on this subject, wrote to me that he believes the method must have a great future. Practical market gardeners (Paris maraicher) whose opinion I have asked, see, of course, nothing extravagant in that idea. 

With plants yielding 1000 grains each---and in the Capelle experiment they yielded an average of 600 grains---the yearly wheat-food of one individual man (5.65 bushels or 265 lbs.), -which is represented by from 5,000,000 to 5,500,000 grains, could be grown on a space of 250 square yards; while for an experienced hand replanting would represent no more than ten to twelve hours' work. With a proper machine-tool, the 

* Dr. M. Fesca, Bcitrdge ztir Kenntniss der yapanesischcn Landwirthschaft. Part ii., p. 33 (Berlin, 1893). The economy in seeds is also considerable. While in Italy 250 kilogrammes to the hectare are sown, and 160 kilogrammes in South Carolina, the Japanese use only sixty kilogrammes for the same area. (Semler, Tropische Agrikiiltiir, Bd. iii., pp. 20-28.)

work could probably be very much reduced. In Japan, two men and two women plant with rice three-quarters of an acre in one day (Ronna, Les Irrigatiofis, vol. iii., 1890, p. 67 seq.). That means (Fesca, Japanesische Landwirthschaft, p. ■^T^ from 33,000 to 66,000 plants, or, let us say, a minimum of 8250 plants a day for one person. The Jersey gardeners plant from 600 (inexperienced) to 1000 plants per hour (experienced). 

M.---Imports of Vegetables to the United Kingdom. 

That the land in this country is not sufficiently utilised for market gardening, and that the largest portion of the vegetables which are imported from abroad could be grown in thiscountry, has been said over and over again within the last few years. 

It is certain that considerable improvements have taken ■place lately---the area under market gardens, and especially the area under glass for the growth of fruit and vegetables, having largely been increased of late. Thus, instead of 38,957 acres, which were given to market-gardening in Great Britain in 1875, there were, in 1894, 88,210 acres, exclusive of vegetable crops on farms, given to that purpose (The Gardener's Chronicle, 20th April, 1895, p. 483). But that increase remains a trifle in comparison with similar increases in France, Belgium, and the United States. In France, the area given to market gardening was estimated in 1892 by M. Baltet {L' horticulture dans les cinq parties du monde, Paris^ Hachette, 1895) at 1,075,000 acres---four times more, in proportion to the cultivable area, than in this country, and the most remarkable of it is that considerable tracts of land formerly treated as uncultivable have been reclaimed for the purposes of market gardening as also of fruit growing. 

As things stand now in this country, we see that very large quantities of the commonest vegetables, each of which could be grown in this country, are imported. 

Lettuces are imported---not only from the Azores or from, the south of France, but they continue until June to be imported from France, where they are mostly grown---not ir* 

APPENDIX. 241 

the open air, but in frames. Early cucumbers, also grown in frames, are largely imported from Holland, and are sold so cheaply that many English gardeners have ceased to grow them.* Even beetroot and pickling cabbage are imported from Holland; and while onions were formerly largely grown in this country, we see that in 1894, 5,288,512 bushels of onions, ^^765, 049 worth, were imported from Belgium (chief importer), Germany, Holland, France, and so on. 

Again, that early potatoes should be imported from the Azores and the south of France is quite natural. It is not so natural, however, that more than 50,000 tons of potatoes {58,060 tons, _;^52i,i4i worth, on the average during the years 1891-4) should be imported from the Channel Islands, because there are hundreds if not thousands of acres in South Devon, and most probably in other parts of the south coast too, where early potatoes could be grown equally well. But besides the 88,200 tons of early potatoes (^710,586 worth) which are imported to this country, no less than 54,100 tons of late potatoes, for which ^441,300 are paid every year, are imported from Holland, Germany and Belgium. And, moreover, this country im.ported, during the same three years, all sorts of green vegetables, for the sum of;^i,o27,4ii (as against ^^467, 290 in 1885) from different countries,! while thousands of acres lie idle, and the country population is •driven to the cities in search of work, without finding it. 

Every one knows how well potatoes succeed in this country, and what admirable sorts of potatoes have been bred by the British growers. But the rent and the middleman absorb the best profits of the grower. I could produce striking facts to prove this last assertion concerning the middleman; but similar facts having already been produced in heaps, it would be useless to swell by more figures an evidence already overwhelming, t

N.---Market Gardening in Belgium. 

In 1885 the superficies given to market gardening in Belgium was 99,600 acres. Now, a Belgian professor of agriculture, who has kindly supplied me with notes on this subject, writes:---

" The area has considerably increased, and I believe it can be taken at 112,000 acres (45,000 hectares), if not more." And further on: " Rents in the neighbourhood of the big towns, Antwerp, Liege, Ghent and Brussels, attain as much as;^5 1 6s. and ^8 per acre; the cost of instalment is from ;£i3 to;^25 per acre; the yearly cost of manure, which is the chief expense, attains from;,^8 to;^i6 per acre the first year, and then from jQc^ to jQ^ every year ". The gardens are of the average size of two and a half acres, and in each garden from 200 to 400 frames are used. About the Belgian market-gardeners the same remark must be made as has been made concerning the French maraichers. They work awfully hard, having to pay extravagant rents, and to lay money aside, with the hope of some day being able to buy a piece of land, and to get rid of the blood-sucker who absorbs so much of their money returns; having moreover every year to buy more and more frames in order to obtain their produce earlier and earlier, so as to fetch higher prices for it, they work like slaves. But it must be remembered that in order to obtain the same amount of produce under glass, in greenhouses, the work of three men only, working fifty-five hours a week, is required in Jersey for cultivating one acre of land under glass. 

O.---Petty Trades in the Lyons Region. 

The neighbourhoods of St. Etienne are a great centre for ail sorts of industries, and among them the petty trades occupy an important place. Iron works and coal mines with their high smoking chimneys; noisy manufactories; roads blackened by coal, and a poor vegetation, give the country the well-known aspects of the " Black Country ". In certain 

APPENDIX. 243 

towns, such as St. Chamond; one finds numbers of big factories in which thousands of women are employed in the fabrication of passementerie. But side by side with the great industry the petty trades also maintain a high development. Thus we have first the fabrication of silk ribbons, in which no less than 50,000 men and women were employed in the year 1885. Only 3000 or 4000 looms were located then in the factories; while the remainder---that is, from 1200 to 1400 looms---belonged to the workers themselves, both at St. Etienne and in the surrounding country.* As a rule the women and the girls spin the silk or make the winding off, while the father with his sons weave the ribbons. I saw these small workshops in the suburbs of St. Etienne, where complicated ribbons (with interwoven addresses of the manufacture), as well as ribbons of high artistic finish, were woven in three to four looms, while in the next room the wife prepared the dinner and attended to household work. 

There was a time when the wages were high in the ribbon trade (reaching over ten francs a day), and M. Euvert wrote me that half of the suburban houses of St. Etienne had been built by the passementiers themselves. But the affairs took a very gloomy aspect when a crisis broke out in 1884. No orders were forthcoming, and the ribbon weavers had to live on casual earnings. All their economies were soon spent. " How many," M. Euvert wrote, " have been compelled to sell for a few hundred francs the loom for which they had paid as many thousand francs." What an effect this crisis has had on the trade I could not say, as I have no recent information about this region. Very probably a great number of the ribbon weavers have emigrated to St. Etienne, where artistic weaving is continued, while the cheapest sorts of ribbon must be made in factories. 

The manufacture of arms occupies from 5000 to 6000 workers, half of whom are in St. Etienne, and the remainder 

* I am indebted for these figures and the following information to M. V. Euvert, President of the Chamber of Commerce of St. Etienne, who sent me, while I was in the Clairvaux prison, in April, 1885, a most valuable sketch of the various industries of the region, in reply to a letter of mine. I avail myself of the opportunity for expressing to M. Euvert my best thanks for his courtesy. 

244 FIELDS, FACTORIES AND WORKSHOPS. 

in the neighbouring county. All work is done in small workshops, save in the great arm factory of the State, which sometimes will employ from 10,000 to 15,000 persons, and sometimes only a couple of thousand men. 

Another important trade in the same region is the manufacture of hardware, which is all made in small workshops, in the neighbourhoods of St. Etienne, Le Chambon, Firminy, Rive de Giers, and St. Bonnet le Chateau. The work is pretty regular, but the earnings are low as a rule. And yet the peasants continue to keep to those trades, as they cannot go on without some industrial occupation during part of the year. 

The yearly production of silk stuffs in France attained no less than 7,558,000 kilogrammes in 1881;* and most of the 5,000,000 to 6,000,000 kilogrammes of raw silk which were manufactured in the Lyons region were manufactured by hand.t Twenty years before, i.e., about 1865, there were only from 6000 to 8000 power-looms, and when we take into account both the prosperous period of the Lyons silk industry about 1876, and the crisis which it underwent in 1880-6, we cannot but wonder about the slowness of the transformation of the industry. Such is also the opinion of the President of the Lyons Chamber of Commerce, who wrote me that the domain of the power-loom is increased every year, " by including new kinds of stuffs, which formerly were reputed as unfeasible in the power-looms; but," he added, " the transformation of small workshops into factories still goes on so slowly that the total number of power-looms reaches only from 20^000 to 25,000 out of an aggregate of from 100,000 to 110,000 ". 

The leading features of the Lyons silk industry are the following:---

+ I take these figures from a detailed letter which the President of the Lyons Chamber of Commerce kindly directed to me in April, 1885, to Clairvaux, in answer to my inquiries about the subject. I avail myself of this opportunity for addressing to him my best thanks for his most interesting communication. 

APPENDIX. 245 

is mostly made in small workshops, chiefly at Lyons, with only a few workshops of the kind in the villages. Dyeing and finishing are also made, of course, in great factories, and it is especially in dyeing, which occupies 4000 to 5000 hands, that the Lyons manufacturers have attained their highest repute. Not only silks are dyed there, but also cottons and wools, and not only for France, but also to some extent for London, Manchester, Vienna, and even Moscow. It is also in this branch that the best machines have to be mentioned.* 

As to the weaving, it is made, as we just saw, on from 20,000 to 25,000 power-looms and from 75,000 to 90,000 hand-looms, which partly are at Lyons (from 15,000 to 18,000 hand-looms in 1885) and chiefly in the villages. The workshops, where one might formerly find several compagnons employed by one master, have a tendency to disappear, the workshops mostly having now but from two to three handlooms, on which the father, the mother and the children are working together. In each house, in each storey of the Croix Rousse, you find until now such small workshops. The fabricant gives the general indications as to the kind of stuff he desires to be woven, and his draughtsmen design the pattern, but it is the workman himself who must find the way to weave in threads of all colours the patterns sketched on paper. He thus continually creates something new; and many improvements and discoveries have been made by workers whose very names remain unknown, t 

The Lyons weavers have retained until now the character of being the elite of their trade in higher artistic work in silk stuffs. The finest, really artistic brocades, satins and velvets, are woven in the smallest workshops, where one or two looms only are kept. Unhappily the unsettled character of the demand for such a high style of work is often a cause of misery amongst them. In former times, when the orders for

246 FIELDS, FACTORIES AND WORKSHOPS. 

higher sorts of silks became scarce, the Lyons weavers resorted to the manufacture of stuffs of lower qualities: foulards, crepes, tulles, of which Lyons had the monopoly in Europe. But now the commoner kinds of goods are manufactured by the million, on the one side by the factories of Lyons, Saxony, Russia and Great Britain, and on the other side by peasants in the neighbouring departments of France, as well as in the Swiss villages of the cantons of Basel and Zurich, and in the villages of the Rhine provinces, Italy and Russia. 

The emigration of the French silk industr}from the towns to the villages began long ago, i.e., about 181 7, but it was especially in the sixties that this movement took a great development. About the year 1872 nearly 90,000 hand-looms were scattered, not only in the Rh&ne department, but also in those of Ain, Is^re, Loire, Sa8ne-et-Loire, and even those of Drome, Ard^che and Savoie. Sometimes the looms were supplied by the merchants, but most of them were bought by the weavers themselves, and it was especially women and girls who worked on them at the hours free from agriculture. But already since 1835 the emigration of the silk industry from the city to the villages began in the shape of great factories erected in the villages, and such factories continue to spread in the countlry, making terrible havoc amidst the rural populations. 

When a new factory is built in a village it attracts at once the girls, and partly also the boys of the neighbouring peasantry. The girls and boys are always happy to find an independent livelihood which emancipates them from the control of the family. Consequently, the wages of the factory girls are extremely low. At the same time the distance from the village to the factory being mostly great, the girls cannot return home every day, the less so as the hours of labour are usually long. So they stay all the week at the factory, in barracks, and they only return home on Saturday evening; while at sunrise on Monday a waggon makes the tour of the villages, and brings them back to the factory. Barrack life---not to mention its moral consequences---soon renders the girls quite unable to work in the fields. And, 

APPENDIX. 247 

when they are grown up, they discover that they cannot maintain themselves at the low wages offered by the factory; but they can no more return to peasant life. It is easy to see what havoc the factory is thus doing in the villages, and how unsettled is its very existence, based upon the very low wages offered to country girls. It destroys the peasant home, it renders the life of the town worker still more precarious on account of the competition it makes to him; and the trade itself is in a perpetual state of unsettledness. 

p.---Small Industries at Paris. 

It would be impossible to enumerate here all the varieties of small industries which are carried on at Paris; nor would such an enumeration be complete, because every year new industries are brought into life. I therefore will mention only a few of the most important industries. 

A great number of them are connected, of course, with ladies' dress. The confections, that is, the making of various parts of ladies' dress, occupy no less than 22,000 operatives at Paris, and their production attains ^^3,000,000 every year, while gowns give occupation to 15,000 women, whose annual production is valued at;£2,40o,ooo. Linen, shoes, gloves, and so on, are as many important branches of the petty trades and the Paris domestic industries, while one-fourth part of the stays which are sewn in France (;^5oo,ooo out of ;^2, 000,000) are made at Paris. 

Engraving, book-binding, and all kinds of fancy stationery, as well as the manufacture of musical and mathematical instruments, are again as many branches in which the Pans workmen excel. Basket-making is another very important item, the finest sorts only being made in Paris, while the plainest sorts are made in the above-mentioned centres (Haute Marne, Aisne, etc.). Brushes are also made in small workshops, the trade being valued at;^8oo,ooo both at Paris and in the neighbouring department of Oise. 

For furniture, there are at Paris as many as 4340 workshops, in which three or four operatives per workshop are 

248 FIELDS, FACTORIES AND WORKSHOPS. 

employed on the average. In the watch trade we find 2000 workshops with only 6000 operatives, and their production, about;^i, 000,000, reaches nevertheless nearly one-third part of the total watch production in France. The maroquinerie gives the very high figure of;^5 00,000, although it employs only 1000 persons, scattered in 280 workshops, this high figure itself testifying to the high artistic value of the Paris leather fancy goods. The jewelry, both for articles of luxury, and for all descriptions of cheap goods, is again one of the specialities of the Paris petty trades; and another well-known speciality is the fabrication of artificial flowers. Finally, we must mention the carriage and saddlery trades, which are carried on in the small towns round Paris; the making of fine straw hats; glass cutting, and painting on glass and china; and numerous workshops for fancy buttons, attire in mother-of-pearl, and small goods in horn and bone. 

Q.---Petty Trades in Germany. 

The literature of the small industries in Germany being very bulky, the chief works upon this subject may be found, either in full or reviewed, in Schmoller's Jahrhikher, and in Conrad's Sammlung itatioiial-dko7tomischer und statistischer Abhandlungen. For a general review of the subject and rich bibliographical indications, SchOnberg's V olkwirthschaftslehre, vol. ii., which contains excellent remarks about the proper domain of small industries (p. 401 seq.), as well as the abovementioned publication of K. Blicher {Uiitersuchiaigen iiber die Lage des Handwerks in Deutschland), will be found most valuable. The work of O. Schwarz, Die Betriebsfor?7ien der niodernen Grossindustrie (in Zeitschrift fiir Staatswissenschaft, vol. xxv., p. 535), is interesting by its analysis of the respective advantages of both the great and the small industries, which brings the author to formulate the following three factors in favour of the former: (i) economy in the cost of motive power; (2) division of labour and its harmonic organisation; and (3) the advantages offered for the sale of the produce. Of these three factors, the first is more and more eliminated 

APPENDIX. 249 

every year by the progress achieved in the transmission of power; the second exists in small industries as well, and to the same extent, as in the great ones (watchmakers, toymakers, and so on); so that only the third remains in full force; but this factor as already mentioned in the text of this book, is a social factor which entirely depends upon the degree of development of the spirit of association amongst the producers. As to Schwarz's figures relative to the higher productivity of great spinning mills as compared with smaller ones, it remains to be known whether the large mills which he mentions are not more modern than the small ones, and are not provided, therefore, with better machinery. One conclusion of Schwarz is, however, absolutely correct: small industries, unless they are engaged in the production of artistic goods, as is the case at Paris, Lyons, Warsaw, Vienna,, and so on, can thrive only in connection with agriculture.
