Hi, I'm Caden Haustein. I'm a student doing open-source work on [my Github](https://github.com/brightly-salty), especially on my current project du jour, [mlatu](https://github.com/mlatu-lang/mlatu). I also operate this website, both library and blog, which reflects my interests in economics and theology.

My preferred form of contact is email: [caden@cadenhaustein.com](mailto:caden@cadenhaustein.com).

I operate this website on my own dime, so if you could donate a few bucks to keep it running, it would be very much appreciated. You can do so at <https://ko-fi.com/cadenhaustein>.
