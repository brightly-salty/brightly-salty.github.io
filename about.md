Hi, I'm Caden Haustein. I do lots of open-source work on [my Github](https://github.com/brightly-salty), especially on my current project du jour, [mlatu](https://github.com/mlatu-lang/mlatu). I also operate this website.

My preferred form of contact is email: [caden@cadenhaustein.com](mailto:caden@cadenhaustein.com). I'd love to meet you!

If you can, please consider buying me a coffee to support me and my work!
