Hi, I'm Caden Haustein. I do lots of open-source work on [my Github](https://github.com/brightly-salty), especially on my current project du jour, [mlatu](https://github.com/mlatu-lang/mlatu).

I'm available for part-time and contract work if you have an interesting project. I'm willing to learn a new language in the job but am already familiar with Rust, Haskell, Nim, Prolog, Erlang, and, of course, mlatu. If you're interested, [contact me](/contact.html).
