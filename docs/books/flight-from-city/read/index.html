<h1>Prelude</h1>
<p>THIS book is written in response to hundreds of requests for some
detailed description of the way of life and of the experiments with
domestic production referred to in my previous book, <em>This Ugly
Civilization</em>. Since the collapse of the great boom in October,
1929, these requests have greatly increased in number.</p>
<p>It is not an exaggeration of the situation today to say that millions
of urban families are considering the possibility of flight from the
city to the country. But the realization that there had been for fully
half a century a flight of millions from the country to the city seems
to me an essential prelude to consideration of any move back to the
land. Not only had the <em>proportion</em> of farm population to city
population in the United States declined over a long period of years,
but for many years prior to 1930, the <em>total farm population</em> of
the nation itself declined. Since 1930, and the ending of the last
period of city “prosperity,” the movement has completely reversed
itself, as is shown by the table on the following page.</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> Births and deaths not taken into account in
estimates of the movement.</p>
<p>This migration of millions, back and forth, between city and country,
is to me evidence of profound dissatisfaction with living conditions
both in the country and in the city. It is something which those
considering a change in their ways of living should carefully ponder.
The industrialization of agriculture during the past century—its
transformation from a way of life to a commercial business—has very
clearly increased the migration of farmers and farm-bred people from the
country to the city. And since most of the migrants in the other
direction—from the city to the country—actually consist of people who at
one time had lived on farms, it is evident that what we have had for
many years are intolerable conditions in the country driving people out
of the country, and then intolerable conditions in the city, driving
them back again.</p>
<p>The question to which I have been seeking an answer is whether the
way of life described in this book is a way out for a population
evidently unhappy both in the city and in the country. Those who are
interested in this question, and those who are considering such a way of
living, may find in this volume an answer to many of the problems which
perplex them in connection with it. Those who are interested in the
broader implications of the Borsodi family’s quest of comfort in a
civilization evidently intolerably uncomfortable will find them fully
discussed in <em>This Ugly Civilization</em>.</p>
<p>We are living in one of the most interesting periods in the world’s
history. Industrial civilization is either on the verge of collapse or
of rebirth on a new social basis. Men and women who desire to escape
from dependence upon the present industrial system and who have no
desire to substitute for it dependence upon a state controlled system,
are beginning to experiment with a way of living which is neither city
life nor farm life, but which is an effort to combine the advantages and
to escape the disadvantages of both. Reports of the Department of
Agriculture call attention to the revival of handicraft industries—the
making of rugs and other textiles, furniture, baskets and pottery—for
sale along the roads, in near-by farmers’ markets, or for barter for
other products for the farm and home. Farmers, according to the Bureau
of Home Economics, are turning back to custom milling of flour because
they can thus get a barrel of flour for five bushels of wheat, whereas
by depending upon the milling industry they have to “pay” eighteen
bushels of wheat for the same quantity of flour.</p>
<p>According to the same authority, meat clubs have been growing in
number; a heavier canning and preserving program is being carried out;
bread-baking, churning, cheese-making and other home food-production
activities have been revived; home sewing has increased greatly, and on
some farms where sheep are raised, skills and equipment little used for
many years are being called upon to convert home-grown wool into
clothing and bed coverings; soap-making for family use has increased;
farm-produced fuel is being used more freely; lumber made from the farm
wood-lot is being used for repairs to the house and for
furniture-making. The movement toward subsistence farming is receiving
extraordinary official recognition and support. President Roosevelt
flatly and frankly announces as a major policy of his administration and
as a primary purpose of his life to <em>put into effect a
back-to-the-land movement that will work</em>. “There is a necessary
limit,” he said early in 1930, “to the continuance of the migration from
the country to the city, and I look, in fact, for a swing of the
pendulum in the other direction. All things point that way… The great
objective… aims at making country life in every way as desirable as city
life—an objective which will, from the economic side, make possible the
earning of an adequate compensation, and on the social side, the
enjoyment of all the necessary advantages which exist today in the
cities.” Under the President’s leadership, appropriations by the
Congress for the promotion of subsistence farming and for the
development of self-help organizations have already been made.</p>
<p>In Dayton, Ohio, for nearly a year, a sociological experiment of
far-reaching significance has been under way. In this industrial city,
the support of the Council of Social Agencies has been given to an
organized movement based upon production for use (as contrasted with
production for the market), and for homesteading with domestic
production, as described in this book. As consulting economist for the
Dayton movement, it has been my privilege to watch a development which
promises, because of the interest other cities are taking in it, to make
social history. The recent development of the homestead movement in
Dayton is described in the chapter entitled “Postlude,” a sort of
postscript to this book. Even if this movement fails to develop a new
and better social order, as many of those working in it have faith that
it will, there is no doubt in my mind that innumerable families will be
helped by it to a more secure, more independent, more expressive way of
life.</p>

<section id="flight-from-the-city" class="level1">
<h1>Flight From the City</h1>
<p>In 1920 the Borsodi family—my wife, my two small sons, and
myself—lived in a <em>rented</em> home. We <em>bought</em> our food and
clothing and furnishings from retail stores. We were <em>dependent</em>
entirely upon my income from a none too certain white-collar job.</p>
<p>We lived in New York City—the metropolis of the country. We had the
opportunity to enjoy the incredible variety of foodstuffs which pour
into that great city from every corner of the continent; to live in the
most luxurious apartments built to house men and women in this country;
to use the speedy subways, the smart restaurants, the great office
buildings, the libraries, theaters, public schools—all the thousand and
one conveniences which make New York one of the most fantastic creations
in the history of man. Yet in the truest sense, we could not enjoy any
of them.</p>
<p>How could we enjoy them when we were financially insecure and never
knew when we might be without a job; when we lacked the zest of living
which comes from real health and suffered all the minor and sometimes
major ailments which come from too much excitement, too much artificial
food, too much sedentary work, and too much of the smoke and noise and
dust of the city; when we had to work just as hard to get to the places
in which we tried to entertain ourselves as we had to get to the places
in which we worked; when our lives were barren of real beauty—the beauty
which comes only from contact with nature and from the growth of the
soil, from flowers and fruits, from gardens and trees, from birds and
animals?</p>
<p>We couldn’t. Even though we were able for years and years, like so
many others, to forget the fact—to ignore it amid the host of
distractions which make up city life.</p>
<p>And then in 1920, the year of the great housing shortage, the house
in which we were living was sold over our heads. New York in 1920 was no
place for a houseless family. Rents, owing to the shortage of building
which dated back to the World War, were outrageously high. Evictions
were epidemic—to enable rapacious landlords to secure higher rents from
new tenants—and most of the renters in the city seemed to be in the
courts trying to secure the protection of the Emergency Rent Laws. We
had the choice of looking for an equally endurable home in the city, of
reading endless numbers of classified advertisements, of visiting
countless real estate agents, of walking weary miles and climbing
endless flights of steps, in an effort to rent another home, or of
flight from the city. And while we were trying to prepare ourselves for
the struggle with this typical city problem, we were overcome with
longing for the country—for the security, the health, the leisure, the
beauty we felt it must be possible to achieve there. Thus we came to
make the experiment in living which we had often discussed but which we
had postponed time and again because it involved so radical a change in
our manner of life.</p>
<p>Instead, therefore, of starting the irritating task of house and
apartment hunting, we wrote to real estate dealers within commuting
distance of the city. We asked them for a house which could be readily
remodelled; a location near the railroad station because we had no
automobile; five to ten acres of land with fruit trees, garden space,
pasturage, a wood-lot, and if possible a brook; a location where
electricity was available, and last but not least, a low purchase price.
Even if the place we could afford only barely complied with these
specifications, we felt confident that we could achieve economic freedom
on it and a degree of comfort we never enjoyed in the city. All the
other essentials of the good life, not even excepting schooling for our
two sons, we decided we could produce for ourselves if we were unable to
buy in a neighborhood which already possessed them.</p>
<p>We finally bought a place located about an hour and three-quarters
from the city. It included a small frame house, one and a half stories
high, containing not a single modern improvement—there was no plumbing,
no running water, no gas, no electricity, no steam heat. There were an
old barn, and a chicken-house which was on the verge of collapse, and a
little over seven acres of land. There was a little fruit in the
orchard—some apples, cherries, and plums, but of the apples at least
there were plenty. An idea of the modesty of the first Borsodi homestead
can be secured from the picture on page 64, though the picture shows it
after we had spent nearly two years repainting and remodelling the tiny
little building. Yet “Sevenacres,” as we called the place, was large
enough for our initial experiment. Four years later we were able to
select a more suitable site and begin the building of the sort of home
we really wanted.</p>
<p>We began the experiment with three principal assets,
courage—foolhardiness, our city friends called it; a vision of what
modern methods and modern domestic machinery might be made to do in the
way of eliminating drudgery, and the fact that my wife had been born and
had lived up to her twelfth year on a ranch in the West. She at least
had had childhood experience of life in the country.</p>
<p>But we had plenty of liabilities. We had little capital and only a
modest salary. We knew nothing about raising vegetables, fruit, and
poultry. All these things we had to learn. While I was a handy man, I
had hardly ever had occasion to use a hammer and saw (a man working in
an office rarely does), and yet if our experiment was to succeed it
required that I should make myself a master of all trades. We cut
ourselves off from the city comforts to which we had become so
accustomed, without the countryman’s material and spiritual
compensations for them.</p>
<p>We went to the country with nothing but our city furniture. We began
by adding to this wholly unsuitable equipment for pioneering, an
electric range. This was the first purchase in the long list of domestic
machines with which we proposed to test our theory that it was possible
to be more comfortable in the country than in the city, with security,
independence, and freedom to do the work to which we aspired thrown in
for good measure.</p>
<p>Discomforts were plentiful in the beginning. The hardships of those
early years are now fading into a romantic haze, but they were real
enough at the time. A family starting with our handicaps had to expect
them. But almost from the beginning there were compensations for the
discomforts.</p>
<p>Before the end of the first year, the year of the depression of 1921
when millions were tramping the streets of our cities looking for work,
we began to enjoy the feeling of plenty which the city-dweller never
experiences. We cut our hay; gathered our fruit; made gallons and
gallons of cider. We had a cow, and produced our own milk and butter,
but finally gave her up. By furnishing us twenty quarts of milk a day
she threatened to put us in the dairy business. So we changed to a pair
of blooded Swiss goats. We equipped a poultry-yard, and had eggs,
chickens, and fat roast capons. We ended the year with plenty not only
for our own needs but for a generous hospitality to our friends—some of
whom were out of work—a hospitality which, unlike city hospitality, did
not involve purchasing everything we served our guests.</p>
<p>To these things which we produced in our first year, we have since
added ducks, guineas, and turkeys; bees for honey; pigeons for
appearance; and dogs for company. We have in the past twelve years built
three houses and a barn from stones picked up on our place; we weave
suitings, blankets, carpets, and draperies; we make some of our own
clothing; we do all of our own laundry work; we grind flour, corn meal,
and breakfast cereals; we have our own workshops, including a printing
plant; and we have a swimming-pool, tennis-court, and even a
billiard-room.</p>
<p>In certain important respects our experiment was very different from
the ordinary back-to-the-land adventure. We quickly abandoned all
efforts to raise anything to sell. After the first year, during which we
raised some poultry for the market, this became an inviolable principle.
We produced only for our own consumption. If we found it difficult to
consume or give away any surplus, we cut down our production of that
particular thing and devoted the time to producing something else which
we were then buying. We used machinery wherever we could, and tried to
apply the most approved scientific methods to small-scale production. We
acted on the theory that there was always some way of doing what we
wanted to do, if we only sought long enough for the necessary
information, and that efficient machinery would pay for itself in the
home precisely as it pays for itself in the factory.</p>
<p>The part which domestic machinery has played in making our adventure
in homesteading a success cannot be too strongly emphasized. Machinery
enabled us to eliminate drudgery; it furnished us skills which we did
not possess, and it reduced the costs of production both in terms of
money and in terms of labor. Not only do we use machines to pump our
water, to do our laundry, to run our refrigerator—we use them to produce
food, to produce clothing, to produce shelter.</p>
<p>Some of the machines we have purchased have proved
unsatisfactory—something which is to be expected since so little real
thought has been devoted by our factory-dominated inventors and
engineers to the development of household equipment and domestic
machinery. But taking the machines and appliances which we have used as
a whole, it is no exaggeration to say that we started our quest of
comfort with all the discomforts possible in the country, and, because
of the machines, we have now achieved more comforts than the average
prosperous city man enjoys.</p>
<p>What we have managed to accomplish is the outcome of nothing but a
conscious determination to use machinery for the purpose of eliminating
drudgery from the home and to produce for ourselves enough of the
essentials of living to free us from the thralldom of our
factory-dominated civilization.</p>
<p>What are the social, economic, political, and philosophical
implications of such a type of living? What would be the consequence of
a widespread transference of production from factories to the home?</p>
<p>If enough families were to make their homes economically productive,
cash-crop farmers specializing in one crop would have to abandon farming
as a business and go back to it as a way of life. The packing-houses,
mills, and canneries, not to mention the railroads, wholesalers, and
retailers, which now distribute agricultural products would find their
business combined to the production and distribution of exotic
foodstuffs. Food is our most important industry. A war of attrition,
such as we have been carrying on all alone, if extended on a large
enough scale, would put the food industry out of its misery, for
miserable it certainly is, all the way from the farmers who produce the
raw materials to the men, women, and children who toil in the canneries,
mills, and packing-towns, and in addition reduce proportionately the
congestion, adulteration, unemployment, and unpleasant odors to all of
which the food industry contributes liberally.</p>
<p>If enough families were to make their homes economically productive,
the textile and clothing industries, with their low wages, seasonal
unemployment, cheap and shoddy products, would shrink to the production
of those fabrics and those garments which it is impractical for the
average family to produce for itself.</p>
<p>If enough families were to make their homes economically productive,
undesirable and non-essential factories of all sorts would disappear and
only those which would be desirable and essential because they would be
making tools and machines, electric light bulbs, iron and copper pipe,
wire of all kinds, and the myriad of things which can best be made in
factories, would remain to furnish employment to those benighted human
beings who prefer to work in factories.</p>
<p>Domestic production, if enough people turned to it, would not only
annihilate the undesirable and non-essential factory by depriving it of
a market for its products. It would do more. It would release men and
women from their present thralldom to the factory and make them masters
of machines instead of servants to them; it would end the power of
exploiting them which ruthless, acquisitive, and predatory men now
possess; it would free them for the conquest of comfort, beauty and
understanding.</p>

<h1>Domestic Production</h1>
<p>With Newton, it was the falling of an apple which led to the
discovery of gravitation. With Watts, it was the popping of the lid of a
boiling kettle which led to the invention of the steam-engine. With the
Borsodi family, it was the canning of tomatoes which led to the
discovery of domestic production. Out of that discovery came not only an
entirely new theory of living; it led to my writing several books
dealing with various phases of the discover–<em>National Advertising
vs. Prosperity</em> was the first; then came <em>The Distribution
Age</em>, finally <em>This Ugly Civilization</em>.</p>
<p>In the summer of 1920—the first summer after our flight from the
city—Mrs. Borsodi began to can and preserve a supply of fruits and
vegetables for winter use. I remember distinctly the pride with which
she showed me, on my return from the city one evening, the first jars of
tomatoes which she had canned. But with my incurable bent for economics,
the question “Does it really pay?” instantly popped into my head.
Mrs. Borsodi had rather unusual equipment for doing the work
efficiently. She cooked on an electric range; she used a steam-pressure
cooker; she had most of the latest gadgets for reducing the labor to a
minimum. I looked around the kitchen, and then at the table covered with
shining glass jars filled with tomatoes and tomato juice.</p>
<p>“It’s great,” I said, “but does it really pay?”</p>
<p>“Of course it does,” was her reply.</p>
<p>“Then it ought to be possible to prove that it does—even if we take
into consideration every cost—the cost of raw materials, the value of
the labor put into the work yourself, the fuel, the equipment.”</p>
<p>“That ought to be easy,” she maintained.</p>
<p>It didn’t prove as easy as we anticipated. We spent not only that
evening, but many evenings, trying to arrive at a fairly accurate answer
to the question. It wasn’t even easy to arrive at a satisfactory figure
on the cost of raw materials she had used. Some of the tomatoes had been
grown in our own garden; some had been purchased. How much had it cost
us to produce the tomatoes we had raised? We had kept no figures on
gardening costs. Even if we had kept track of all the odd times during
which we had worked in the garden, that would have helped little without
a record of the time put into caring for the single row of tomato plants
we had planted.</p>
<p>It proved equally difficult to determine how much time should be
charged to the actual work of canning—since several different kinds of
household tasks in addition to canning were often performed at the same
time. While the jars were processing in the pressure cooker, work having
nothing to do with canning was often performed.</p>
<p>And when it came to determining how much electric current had been
used—how much to charge for salt, spices, and other supplies—the very
smallness of the quantities used made it difficult to arrive at a figure
which approximated the facts. However, by abandoning the effort to
determine gardening costs, and labor costs, and substituting the market
value for both raw materials and for labor, we did finally come to
figures which I felt we might use.</p>
<p>Then we still had the problem of determining what it had cost to buy
canned tomatoes; we had to buy canned goods in a number of different
stores so as to get a fair average price on the cannery-made product; of
making certain that they were of a quality similar to those which we had
produced at home, and of reducing the quantity in each can and each jar
to some unit which would make comparison possible quantitatively as well
as qualitatively. <em>When we finally made the comparison, the cost of
the home-made product was between 20% and 30% lower than the price of
the factory-made merchandise</em>.</p>
<p>The result astonished me. That there would be a saving, if no charge
were made for labor, I expected. I was prepared to find that it paid to
can tomatoes whenever the cash income of a family was so low that
anything which might be secured for the housewife’s labor was a gain.
But after every item of expense had been taken into account, and after
analysing the costs of domestic production as carefully as I would have
analyzed similar costs in such a cannery as that of the Campbell Soup
Company, that a saving should be shown was astonishing. How was it
possible, I kept asking myself, for a woman, working all alone, to
produce canned goods at a lower cost than could the Campbell Soup
Company with its fine division of labor, its efficient management, its
labor-saving machinery, its quantity buying, its mass-production
economies? Unless there was some mistake in our calculations this
experiment knocked all the elaborate theories framed by economists to
explain the industrial revolution, into a cocked hat. Unless we had
failed to take some element of which I was ignorant into consideration,
the economic activities of mankind for nearly two hundred years had been
based upon a theory as false as its maritime activities prior to the
discovery of the fact that the world was round.</p>
<p>Slowly I evolved an explanation of the paradox. First I sought for it
in advertising. I wrote a whole book, <em>National Advertising
vs. Prosperity</em>, about my excursions into, the much-neglected field
of advertising economics. Advertising, however, furnished only a partial
answer to the question. While I did come to the conclusion that certain
kinds of advertising involved economic wastes, I discovered that the
bulk of advertising had no more effect upon prices than any other
activities incidental to the creation of time and place utilities.
Articles discussing my analysis of the economics of advertising were
published in the trade press in 1922; my book appeared a year later, in
1923.</p>
<p>My voyage of discovery into the realm of advertising economics led to
a deeper search for the truth. Three years later, in 1926, I published
the results of several years of study in a book (for which Lew Hahn
wrote the introduction) , which I called <em>The Distribution
Age</em>.</p>
<p>Here I came much nearer to a satisfactory explanation of the curious
results of our cost studies of home canning. Factory production costs
had, it is true, decreased year after year as industry had developed.
Nothing had developed to stop the factory in its successful competition
with handicraft industry, so far as costs of production were concerned.
Our economists, therefore, took it for granted that the superiority of
the factory in competition with the home would continue indefinitely
into the future. What they overlooked, however, was that while
production costs decrease year after year, distribution costs increase.
The tendency of distribution and transportation to absorb more and more
of the economies made possible by factory production was ignored.
Transportation, warehousing, advertising, salesmanship, wholesaling,
retailing all these aspects of distribution cost more than the whole
cost of fabricating the goods themselves. Less than one-third of what
the consumer pays when actually buying goods at retail is paid for the
raw materials and costs of manufacturing finished commodities; over
two-thirds is paid for distribution. While we were busily reducing the
amount of labor needed to produce things—as the technocrats recently
discovered—we were busily engaged in increasing the numbers employed to
transport, and sell, and deliver the products which we were consuming.
That a time might come when all the economies of factory production
would be lost in the cost of getting the product from the points of
production to the points of consumption had been generally ignored.</p>
<p>Eventually I stumbled on an economic law which still seems to me the
only satisfactory explanation of our adventure with the canned tomatoes:
<em>Distribution costs tend to move in inverse relationship to
production costs</em>. The more production costs are reduced in our
factories, the higher distribution costs on factory products become. At
some point in the case of most products a time comes when it is cheaper
to produce them individually than to buy them factory made. Nothing that
we can do to lower distribution costs by increasing the efficiency of
our railroads, and nothing that we can do to eliminate competition as
socialists propose, upsets this law. As long as we stick to the
industrial production of goods this law is operative.</p>
<p>A simple illustration makes this clear. With factory production,
large quantities of one product are made in one spot. To use automatic
machinery, to divide labor most efficiently, to transport raw materials
inexpensively, it is necessary to manufacture in quantity. Raw materials
and fuel must therefore be assembled from long distances before the
process of fabrication can begin. After the raw materials have been
fabricated into finished goods—a process which may require movement of
the semi-manufactured goods back and forth among several plants located
at different points of the country—the finished goods must be
transported and stored at the points of consumption until the public is
ready to use them. The larger factories are made in order to lower
production costs, the greater become the distances and the more
intricate the problems involved in assembling the raw materials and
distributing the finished goods. Thus the lower we make the factory
costs, the higher become the distribution costs.</p>
<p>It cost the Campbell Soup Company much less to produce a can of
tomatoes in their great factories than it cost Mrs. Borsodi to produce
one in her kitchen. But after they had produced theirs, all the costs of
getting it from their factory to the ultimate consumer had to be added.
In Mrs. Borsodi’s case the first cost was the final cost. No
distribution costs had to be added because the point of production and
the point of consumption was the same.</p>
<p>All the orthodox economic teachings to which I had subscribed
underwent a complete transformation as soon as I fully digested the
implications of this discovery.</p>
<p>I discovered that more than two-thirds of the things which the
average family now buys could be produced more economically at home than
they could be bought factory made;</p>
<p>–that the average man and woman could earn more by producing at home
than by working for money in an office or factory and that, therefore,
the less time they spent working away from home and the more time they
spent working at home, the better off they would be;</p>
<p>–finally, that the home itself was still capable of being made into a
productive and creative institution and that an investment in a
homestead equipped with efficient domestic machinery would yield larger
returns per dollar of investment than investments in insurance, in
mortgages, in stocks and bonds.</p>
<p>The most modern and expensive domestic machinery need not, therefore,
be a luxury. It can be a productive investment, in spite of the fact
that most manufacturers of appliances still sell their machines on the
basis of a luxury appeal. Even appliances like vacuum cleaners can be
made paying investments, if the time they save is used productively in
the garden, the kitchen, the sewing and loom room.</p>
<p>These discoveries led to our experimenting year after year with
domestic appliances and machines. We began to experiment with the
problem of bringing back into the home, and thus under our own direct
control, the various machines which the textile-mill, the cannery and
packing house, the flour-mill, the clothing and garment factory, had
taken over from the home during the past two hundred years. Needless to
say, we have thus far only begun to explore the possibilities of
domestic production.</p>
<p>In the main the economies of factory production, which are so obvious
and which have led economists so far astray, consist of three things:
(1) quantity buying of materials and supplies; (2) the division of labor
with each worker in industry confined to the performance of a single
operation; and (3) the use of power to eliminate labor and permit the
operation of automatic machinery. Of these, the use of power is
unquestionably the most important. Today, however, power is something
which the home can use to reduce costs of production just as well as can
the factory. The situation which prevailed in the days when water power
and steam-engines furnished the only forms of power is at an end. As
long as the only available form of power was <em>centralized</em> power,
the transfer of machinery and production from the home and the
individual, to the factory and the group, was inevitable. But with the
development of the gas-engine and the electric motor, power became
available in <em>decentralized</em> forms. The home, so far as power was
concerned, had been put in position to compete with the factory.</p>
<p>With this advantage of the factory nullified, its other advantages
are in themselves insufficient to offset the burden of distribution
costs on most products. Furthermore, even these advantages are not as
great as they seem. What is saved through minute division and
subdivision of labor tends often to be nullified by the higher costs of
supervision and management. And the savings in the factory made possible
by quantity buying become more and more minute when the home begins to
produce raw materials itself.</p>
<p>The average factory, no doubt, does produce food and clothing cheaper
than we produce them even with our power-driven machinery on the Borsodi
homestead. But factory costs, because of the problem of distribution,
are only first costs. They cannot, therefore, be compared with home
costs, which are final costs. The final cost of factory products, after
distribution costs have been added, make the great bulk of consumer
goods actually more expensive than home-made products of the same
quality.</p>
<p>This is what we learned from Mrs. Borsodi’s adventure with the
tomatoes.</p>

<section id="food-pure-food-and-fresh-food" class="level1">
<h1>Food, Pure Food, and Fresh Food</h1>
<p>It is a mistake, however, to think of our experiments in domestic
production purely in terms of economics. Particularly is this true of
food. For ours was not only a revolt against the high cost of food. It
was a revolt against the kind of food with which mass production and
mass distribution provides the American consumer.</p>
<p>In common with the overwhelming majority of people, we suffered the
usual run of digestive and catarrhal ailments. We all had colds several
times each year; constipation was something every member of the family
had to fight; between periods of biliousness, headaches, fevers, and
similar visitations, we enjoyed only what might at best be described as
tolerable health. I would not give the impression that we were a sickly
family. On the contrary, so far as health was concerned we were probably
better rather than worse than the average family. Our ailments were
almost never severe enough to keep us in bed. None of us had ever been
confined in a hospital. But saying that our health was slightly better
than average is not saying much.</p>
<p>Partly as a result of an accumulation of accidents and coincidences,
and partly because of our own efforts to find the answer to the riddle
of good health, we finally arrived at the conviction that most of our
ailments, and probably most of the ailments of mankind, were caused by
wrong foods and incorrect eating habits. I remember how amusing this
idea sounded the first time it was propounded to me. Mrs. Borsodi and I,
happening to meet Hereward Carrington, just as we were on our way to
lunch in the city, asked him to join us.</p>
<p>“I’m sorry,” he said, “but I seem to be catching cold, so I am eating
nothing at all today.”</p>
<p>I looked at him with astonishment. The old adage about feeding a cold
and starving a fever came into my mind. What in the world, I thought,
could eating have to do with a cold? “Join us, anyway,” I said. “You can
watch us eat, and the sight of food may tempt you to order something
yourself. And besides, I’m curious to know upon what theory you cut out
eating when you have a cold.”</p>
<p>Carrington accepted the invitation and in the course of that luncheon
Mrs. Borsodi and I listened for the first time to a disinterested
exponent of the theory that improper eating is the cause of most
disease. Up to that time I had always dismissed the idea as the vaporing
of vegetarian and physical culture faddists. But I was by no means
convinced by what Carrington said. I still argued valiantly for the
orthodox medical explanation of disease in terms of germs. The luncheon
failed to convert us to the extreme position which he maintained and
which we have since come to accept. But the incident prepared us for
real conversion shortly thereafter.</p>
<p>Among the books published by the corporation by which I was then
employed were a number of volumes by a Dr. R. L. Alsaker. I had never
read them, principally because they had seemed to me the works of a
dietetic crank. But I brought some of them home after the Carrington
argument and Mrs. Borsodi and I both read them. Alsaker’s arguments
seemed to us quite reasonable. We saw no reason why we should hesitate
about experimenting with diet as a means of maintaining health, the
medical profession having signally failed to keep us healthy. But we did
not find this as easy as might be imagined. Indeed, it was only after a
period of years and after we had moved to the country that we completely
changed our diet from the conventional pattern to our present one.
During this period Mrs. Borsodi made quite a study of the chemistry of
food; we dug up what we could about the fight for pure and unadulterated
foods which Dr. Harvey W. Wiley had waged back in President Theodore
Roosevelt’s administration, and as a result developed a thoroughgoing
distaste for the commercialized foodstuffs which up to that time we had
eaten.</p>
<p>One after another we gave up predigested breakfast foods, white
bread, factory-made biscuits and crackers and cakes, polished rice,
white sugar. But it wasn’t easy to secure suitable substitutes for all
the foods which we believed unfit for human consumption. What should we
do in order to secure clean, raw milk, fresh vegetables, and decent
chickens? The pasteurized milk which we had been drinking for years was
a crime against the human stomach even though the germs which got into
the milk in the course of its progress from the cow-stable to our back
doors were all embalmed and thus rendered harmless. The fresh vegetables
and fruits in the city markets were of necessity of inferior qualities;
they had to be picked green, before they ripened naturally, in order to
make it possible to transport them without too much spoilage. In
addition, they withered and dried out while being shipped, stored and
displayed for sale. Meat came to us from a spick and span butcher shop,
but we could never forget that it had first passed through the
packing-houses which Upton Sinclair had called “the jungle.” After we
moved to the country and acquired the habit of eating fresh-killed
chicken, we could hardly force ourselves to eat chicken in the city.
Nothing which a cook can do to a chicken in the kitchen can disguise for
us the flavor which develops in a chicken after it has been kept for
weeks and possibly for many months in cold storage with all its
intestines intact inside. In the course of our studies of diet we became
conscious for the first time of the fact that all these things were part
and parcel of city living and of the factory packing of foodstuffs to
which industrialism seemed to have irretrievably condemned the consuming
public.</p>
<p>Actually our moving to the country was inspired less by the notion
that we could reduce the cost of living than by the conviction that we
could live better than we had in the city. So far as food was concerned,
better health was more in our minds than saving money. We sought pure
food and fresh food rather than cheap food. The discovery that home
production made it possible for us to enjoy better food <em>at a lower
cost</em> than we had in the city, came later.</p>
<p>We landed in the country on April 1st, a little late in the season,
we have since learned for starting chickens. But since raising chickens
was almost the first item in our food raising program, we went ahead,
anyway. Eggs had always been an important factor in our dietary, we
wanted to have plenty of them, and the supply of fresh chicken which
would accompany egg production would, we felt, cut down what we had been
in the habit of spending for meat of all kinds.</p>
<p>We knew nothing about chickens. For instructions we turned to the
bulletins of the Department of Agriculture in Washington and of the
state agricultural university. We pored over bulletins dealing with
incubation, with raising chicks, with feeding hens for egg production
and fattening poultry for the table. We followed in a general way the
instructions in the bulletins about equipment and housing them. But we
nevertheless decided to feel our way and to try out our book-taught
knowledge before venturing on any considerable investment in our
poultry-yard. Unless experienced personal guidance is available, no
amount of mere reading can prevent the beginner from making mistakes. If
the initial venture is a large one, the mistake may prove financially
disastrous. Some years after we moved to the country, a small,
completely equipped farm near us was purchased by another city migrant.
Ill-health and inability to keep up his work in the city (he was a
newspaper man) had forced this move upon him. It was his idea to raise
chickens for a living. He, too, started out knowing nothing about
chickens and having to rely upon book knowledge for information. But
unlike the Borsodi family, he started out on a large scale, buying 500
day-old chicks from commercial hatcheries to begin. The poultry books
told him that the chicks were to be fed grit and water before they
received their first regular feed. To a countryman, the word grit would
have been self-explanatory. No doubt the author of the bulletin upon
which this man relied did not feel it necessary to explain what grit
was, or, if there was such an explanation in the book, its significance
did not register on our neighbor. At any rate, what he did do was to go
to his barns and look for a sack of grit. Having found what he thought
was grit, he proceeded to feed it to his chickens as instructed. Within
a short time the chickens began to die right and left. He began to lose
chicks in batches of fifty in a single day. And he had hardly any of his
original 500 chicks left when he discovered that what he had thought
grit, in reality was linseed meal. Here was the first of what proved a
series of catastrophic losses for this family. Precious money and even
more precious time was lost, owing to this mistake. Before this man
learned enough about living in the country to produce with any degree of
efficiency (though I believe nothing could have enabled him to produce
profitably for the market), his losses were so great that he had to
abandon the place he had purchased and to return to the city, broken in
pocket and even more broken in spirit. I cannot, therefore, make this
point too strongly—the only alternative to experienced guidance is
experimenting on a small scale. Mistakes then can be considered part of
one’s education.</p>
<p>It is difficult today, when the care of our poultry-yard takes so
little original thinking on our part, to realize how bewildered we were
when we first began with chickens. There was, to begin with, the problem
of breeds. Roughly, all the various breeds of chickens fall into three
categories: egg-laying machines, like the Leghorns; meat-making
chickens, like the Jersey Giants; and all-purpose breeds, like the
Plymouth Rocks and the Rhode Island Reds. The Leghorns do lay more eggs
than the other types, but they are small and wiry birds, hardly fit for
the table. As we wanted plenty of eggs, we decided against the Jersey
Giants. To secure both eggs and decent meat, we finally decided on one
of the all-purpose breeds, Rhode Island Reds, a decision we have never
regretted. The Reds are probably no better than others of the same
general type; there was no special reason for selecting them unless it
was that it was easier for us to get hens and eggs of this breed in our
neighborhood than the others.</p>
<p>We started operations that first spring with a broody hen and a
setting of eggs which we purchased from a neighbor. Later, we repeated
this purchase three or four times. But the first hen had not finished
hatching out her setting (it takes three weeks) when we decided that
hatching eggs out nature’s way wouldn’t give us enough chicks for our
needs. We purchased a sixty-egg incubator, heated by a kerosene-lamp.
While we still set hens, perhaps because “breaking up” broody hens each
year is almost as much trouble as setting them, we believe a good, small
incubator an essential part of an ideal homestead. We purchased eggs
enough to fill the incubator twice that year from farmers who had flocks
of Reds. And we managed to hatch out an exceptionally large proportion
of them. My recollection is that we started our poultry-yard that first
year with about 150 chicks.</p>
<p>This number dwindled down, as is to be expected, to about 100
chickens—half of them pullets and half of them cockerels. The first year
we killed a good many of the cockerels for fries in the course of the
summer. But the second year we came to the conclusion that this was a
most wasteful proceeding, and ordered a set of instruments for
caponizing. Eventually every member of the family learned how to
caponize the cockerels. The operation is rather interesting; it need
never be bloody; and by fattening the capons for six or eight months, we
had eight- and nine-pound capons to eat—a luxury which we had never
enjoyed at home in the city. Indeed, when I came across Philadelphia
capons on restaurant menus, I hadn’t the least notion what a capon
really was; vaguely I thought them some particularly choice breed of
chicken.</p>
<p>The annual food contribution of our poultry-yard, after it was once
established, usually averages twenty or twenty-five capons, an equal
number of old hens, and all the eggs we can eat. There is always a
surplus of eggs in the spring. Sometimes we sell them or turn them in to
our grocer, but usually we prefer to put them down and preserve them in
water glass, which keeps them fit for cooking purposes for the fall and
winter when the production of fresh eggs falls short of our needs.
However, if the chicken-house is of warm construction and especially if
it is electrically lighted in the winter so as to give the hens a full
day at the feed-boxes, a plentiful supply of fresh eggs can be secured
the year round.</p>
<p>A small flock of chickens, kept up each year by raising about
seventy-five chicks, is all that the average family needs. The dividends
per dollar of investment are really enormous, even if all the feed for
them has to be purchased. Owing to the fact that land in our section is
not adapted to grain farming and the fact that we have had to clear
every bit of land for garden purposes, we have purchased nearly all of
our chicken feed. There is no reason, however, why the feed should not
be produced on the homestead if the soil is suitable. This simply
increases the dividends earned and proportionately reduces the family’s
dependence upon income and purchases from the outside. The labor of
feeding and caring for such a flock of chickens is not great, especially
if good equipment and housing is provided. A large poultry project, from
which money is to be made, is an altogether different affair. The
poultry business seems to have a universal popularity. It looks like an
easy way to make a living. But it takes much more experience and much
more ability than the average man possesses to make money at it. We
tried it one year and, while we lost no money on the project (on the
contrary, by ordinary standards it might have been considered a
success), it was one of the experiences which made us decide against the
home production of anything for sale.</p>
<p>A few years after we moved to the country a brother of mine was
ordered to the country by his doctor. We invited him to come to
“Sevenacres” and suggested that he make his expenses by raising eggs and
chickens for the market. So that year we had the opportunity of watching
what happened when the flock grew in size to something like commercial
proportions. The eggs raised sold well and at high prices. The cockerels
were all caponized and in the fall sold to a restaurant in the city. Yet
when we were all through with the year there was precious little to show
for the labor which had been put into them. By the time that feed and
supplies were paid for, pocket money was all that my brother had to show
for his summer’s work. The experiment was well worth while, however,
because it proved one of the things which helped us to decide that any
extra time which we could put into production could be more profitably
used raising other things for our own use than by raising a surplus of
one thing, such as eggs and chickens, for sale.</p>
<p>We have applied this principle to the poultry-yard itself, keeping
the number of chickens down and raising other fowls. We have raised
Peking ducks and found that the Peking duck furnishes almost as many
eggs as do many breeds of chickens, and in addition furnishes a welcome
variation in the diet. We also raise turkeys; we plan to raise at least
one bird for each month for the table, and a flock to be used as
Christmas presents. This particular experiment in the home production of
gifts has been among our most successful; the sentiment surrounding the
turkeys savors of Christmas much more than factory-made gadgets usually
bought in crowded stores. We have also raised pigeons, principally
because they were decorative, and have hatched pheasants principally for
the sake of romance. It is part of our yearly spring thrill to watch for
the first appearance of the cock pheasants and to see them in all their
finery as they begin their courting dances.</p>
<p>A few words must be added on the subject of fresh eggs. We used to
buy so-called fresh eggs in the city, but in the very nature of things
it was impossible for them to be really fresh. Even near-by eggs rarely
get to the city before they are two weeks old. True, the palate of the
city man is so little cultivated that the finer flavors of all sorts of
foods have lost their importance to him. Industrialism and urbanism have
combined to blunt his taste. As to fresh eggs, the Borsodi family
consists of gourmets. The fact that the humble egg has developed a new
value for us is typical of the trans-valuations which have come to us
from our return to nature.</p>
<p>Milk, cream, buttermilk, butter, cheese, ice-cream—all the various
milk products—constituted one of the large items in our food budget when
we lived in the city. Our fluid milk supply consisted of grade A milk,
delivered daily in glass bottles. This milk was pasteurized. We used
creamery butter which at that time was made from raw cream. Since then
efforts have been made to compel creameries to use only pasteurized
milk. Buttermilk we drank only occasionally. After we moved to the
country it became a part of our regular diet; it proved a most healthful
and nourishing foodstuff. Ice-cream we ate in much greater moderation in
the city than we do today, perhaps because of some Puritanical
inhibition about eating too much dessert. But probably the notion was
actually correct, at least with regard to commercial ice-cream, which is
what we used to eat. Certainly the bulk of commercial ice-cream, often
made from rancid cream, artificial coloring, and synthetic flavoring, is
not a desirable food. But even the best commercial ice-cream cannot be
compared with home-made ice-cream and frozen desserts made from clean,
sweet cream, fresh eggs, and real fruit juices. Much of the cheese now
consumed in the city is synthetic, made from something which the
breweries invented and which ought not to be called cheese at all. We
ate little cheese before we left the city; after we went to the country
we began to eat all the pot cheese we could enjoy, and when we learned
how useful a part of the diet cheese can be, we began to buy the kinds
of cheese which we could not make at home.</p>
<p>Our revolt against commercial milk products was helped by one of
those fortuitous incidents which shape all of our lives, though we are
seldom conscious of their importance at the time. Mrs. Borsodi, before
she gave up business, had occasion to visit one of the largest
creameries in the country to secure information for an advertising
campaign. Her disillusionment about the dairy industry and creamery
butter was complete. Modern science, she found, was being used to
produce a tasty and attractive-looking butter from raw materials which
often came into the creamery only fit for slopping to hogs. Of
superficial cleanliness there was plenty, but underneath the scrupulous
surface was the fact that the system was so perfect that no matter what
sort of cream was used, a product which had the appearance of quality
was produced. No doubt in a perfectly organized industrial state, in
which the profit motive has in some way been legislated out of
existence, the technicians who will operate the creameries will
eliminate some of the worst of present-day mass-production evils. We,
however, were not only somewhat cynical about the benefits of unlimited
government supervision, but saw no good reason why we should postpone
the eating of pure and fresh foods until the distant day when a social
revolution would wipe out all the blots on present-day industrial
production. Besides, contacts with state institutions—hospitals, for
instance—prevented us from sharing the sanguine hopes of socialist
friends about the quality of foodstuffs which would be produced in a
socialist heaven.</p>
<p>As soon as we were well settled in the country we bought a cow—too
good a cow, I am afraid. When fresh she gave us as much as twenty quarts
of milk a day. Most of the time we had so much milk that it seemed as if
we could bathe in it. But what milk it was! In spite of the fact that we
drank all we desired, made our own butter and pot cheese, there was
still a surplus of milk to be disposed of. A few neighbors begged us to
sell them milk, but this experience, just like our experience in selling
eggs and chickens, only confirmed our determination not to produce for
the market. We were producing a quality of milk far superior to that in
the market; what we received for it hardly paid for the labor of
cleaning bottles and delivering it. We wondered what we could buy with
the money half so precious as the milk. We needed two or three quarts of
milk daily. Twenty was too much of a good thing. We had no intention of
living on milk alone, nor of going into the dairy business. For a family
of four, the cow was evidently not the best solution of the milk
problem. With a family of six or more persons, it would perhaps have
been different. But for us, using a cow to produce milk was like using a
sledge hammer to drive carpet tacks. We sold the cow and decided to try
Swiss milch goats.</p>
<p>The milch goat is still somewhat of a novelty, handicapped by the
fact that the goat is supposed to be funny. In our judgment it is an
ideal solution of the problem of producing milk for use within the
family. Its milk is richer than cow’s milk in butter fat, and easier to
digest. When the goats are properly fed, it is hard to distinguish its
taste from cow’s milk. We have repeatedly fooled friends of ours who
were prejudiced against it. We bought one pure-blooded Toggenburg doe,
and one grade doe. The grade doe was probably a half-blood; there is no
reason why one should go to the expense of buying pure bloods unless one
intends to go into goat-breeding. Properly selected grade goats will
give practically as much milk and are much less expensive. Two does,
however, should be purchased. Goats are evidently very gregarious; they
fret and hold back their milk if they are without companionship. The
buck is a smelly and obnoxious animal, and the does should be taken to a
buck when ready for breeding. Unlike a cow, which is a perfect nuisance
when in heat, bellowing and carrying on in a most disgraceful manner,
the does are so small that they can be put into any automobile and
quickly taken to a buck for breeding. By breeding one doe so that it
kids in the spring and the other in the fall, two does will furnish a
supply of milk the year round. When fresh, our does gave us about three
quarts of milk daily.</p>
<p>Among the great advantages of the goats was the great reduction in
the labor of milking and caring for them. To milk a quart or two morning
and evening proved a trifling job in comparison with having to fill a
ten-quart pail twice a day. And the goats, unlike the cow, kept
themselves clean. As a matter of fact, they are rather fastidious in
their habits. They will not eat grain or hay which has been trampled
under foot, though they will eat almost any kind of vegetation and are
fond of eating the bark off of trees. This partiality for bark probably
explains their fondness for paper, most of which is made of wood pulp.
They will probably eat the paper off of a tin can, but the notion that
they will eat the tin itself seems to me a silly superstition.</p>
<p>One disadvantage of goats has to do with butter. The fat globule in
goat’s milk does not separate or rise as readily as that in cow’s milk.
If butter is to be made, a cream separator has to be used. With this
piece of apparatus to overcome this disadvantage, it seems to me that
for the small family all the advantages lie on the side of the goat. We
found butter-making, using an efficient rotary churn, a most profitable
activity. There is simply no comparison between fresh, home-made butter
and creamery butter. With a good refrigerator to get the cream to the
proper temperature, the butter forms very quickly. Most of the
operations in butter-making can be done mechanically with an efficient
kitchen mixer.</p>
<p>When we purchased “Sevenacres,” we found ourselves in possession of a
small “farm” little of which was really suitable for farming. There was
plenty of room for garden, though no vegetables and berries had been
raised on the place for many years; there was an old orchard containing
some apple, plum, and cherry trees; there was a hay-field, and a piece
of woodland suitable for a wood-lot. Actual farming operations for us,
when we began to develop our theory of self-sufficiency, seemed to fall
into two divisions one having to do with the growing of vegetables,
berries, fruit, and foodstuffs for our own consumption, and the other
with the growing of feed for the chickens, the goats, and other
livestock. We have had considerable success with the first; with the
second we have tried to do relatively little as yet.</p>
<p>During the four years we were on “Sevenacres” we did not get around
to grain-farming at all, though there was room enough for raising grain
enough for both feed and for our own table. On the “Dogwoods” we have
not as yet cleared enough ground. We have always managed to produce some
hay, and on our new place have usually managed to put away a load of
oats each year which we fed to the Toggenbergs. Eventually we hope to
produce all our own feed, as we believe it thoroughly practicable and
extremely profitable for homesteaders to do so. An acre devoted to corn
and wheat, and a half acre devoted to alfalfa, soy-beans, or closer,
would take care of the feed for all the livestock needed by the average
family, especially if the fields are well fertilized and properly
cultivated. Commercial feed has cost us consistently two or three times
as much as farmers in the grain-growing sections of the country receive
for corn and other grain. Sometimes it has been four times as high. By
the time freight, storage, and handling charges are added to the price
the farmer has received, the price has no resemblance to that in the
primary markets. Even though it costs the homesteader much more to raise
feed than it does the farmer who operates a grain “factory” in the West,
it would cost him less to do so than to buy feed.</p>
<p>Since we have raised so little of our feed, what we have actually
done with our livestock operations has been to substitute a feed bill
monthly for the milk and butter bill, and the egg and poultry bill,
which we used to receive in the city. The feed bills, however, have not
only been much smaller, but have enabled us to enjoy a quality of dairy
and poultry products much higher than we were able to secure in the
city. Some day we shall clear away enough stumps and roots on our new
place so that we can cut out the feed bill as well. When that time
comes, it will be hard for the industrial system to starve us out, no
matter how badly business goes to pot.</p>
<p>A completely vegetarian family could live entirely out of a kitchen
garden and orchard occupying no more than an acre of land. But we never
subscribed to the tenets of this dietetic cult, though we are convinced
that the average American family consumes much more meat than good
health requires. Most of us, so to speak, are digging our graves with
our teeth. Over-eating meat is one of the ways in which the public
generally practices this form of suicide. For this reason we have tried
to increase our consumption of fruits and vegetables and to decrease
correspondingly our consumption of meat. This has made the vegetable
garden and the orchard acquire a place of much greater economic
importance on our homestead than is usual on the average farm, and to
correspondingly decrease the importance of the livestock. For instance,
we have never gone in for hog-raising, even though we are fond of pork.
Between chickens, ducks, and turkeys, and an occasional “bull” calf or
“buck” kid which we did not wish to raise and therefore slaughtered, we
have had plenty of meat. When particularly hungry for ham and pork, we
patronized the local meat market. Families hungrier for meat than the
Borsodi family should raise a couple of pigs each year, buying the young
pigs and fattening them for the fall and winter. This would also furnish
a plentiful supply of lard, a natural food, instead of the chemical fats
which people now use. Butter and chicken fat, however, have enabled us
to get along without purchasing any fats except olive oil.</p>
<p>The vegetable garden should be large enough to supply the family with
fresh vegetables during the growing season and with enough for canning
and dehydrating for the winter. In our garden we go in heavily for
staples such as peas, beans, radishes, carrots, lettuce, cabbages,
turnips, asparagus, rhubarb, potatoes, and sweet corn, but we have
always selected the more toothsome varieties of even these old standbys.
The varieties developed for commercial purposes are notable usually for
size and color rather than flavor. Sweet corn is an instance of this.
For many years we have raised nothing but yellow bantam corn, which we
believe far superior in quality to the large, white ears which we used
to get in the city markets. Incidentally, sweet corn fresh from the
garden, before the sugar in the corn has had a chance to turn into
starch, is a very different foodstuff from sweet corn after it has been
shipped to the city and more or less dried out in the process. Even a
dull palate has no difficulty in noticing the difference.</p>
<p>Such a garden is a much larger undertaking than the usual suburban
backyard project. Unless one is content to devote oneself to
back-breaking drudgery, the garden cannot be taken care of with a spade
for “plowing” and an old-fashioned hoe for “cultivation.” We turned to
the wheel hoe, one of the simplest of agricultural implements, for help
in reducing the labor to manageable proportions. This relatively
inexpensive piece of machinery reduced the labor to a point where it
demanded no more of my time and strength than should be given to some
form of exercise regularly every day. The investment of $3.50 to $5 in
this implement with its set of attachments of plows, weeders,
cultivators and rakes, pays for itself over and over again in a single
year. Except when plowing and planting, it makes it possible to use our
“man” power without abusing it. In the spring and the fall, when
planting or harvesting is under way, the whole family goes to the garden
and the heavier labor at that time is turned into a sort of family game.
It is an amusing fact that the garden has furnished me exercise for
which we had to pay money in the city. There, to keep oneself fit, one
has to turn to gymnasiums or to golf.</p>
<p>We have experimented with the use of power in farming. But power is
really unnecessary on the scale we have operated. We have a Fordson
tractor on our place, but it was purchased only because we had to clear
the land on which we built our new home. It more than paid for itself in
excavating, in road-making, and in hauling timbers and stones at the
“Dogwoods.” Even the small garden tractor, which represents an
investment of around $200 today, is of doubtful utility unless the
homestead goes in for field corn, wheat, and other grains. Then, of
course, either a horse or small tractor becomes a paying investment,
with the horse perhaps the better of the two under present conditions.
It takes money to buy gasoline and oil; the fuel for the horse can be
produced on the farm. The horse, too, makes it possible to reduce
expenditures for fertilizer. No wonder that since the depression there
has been a decided increase in the use of horses for farming and a
corresponding decline in the use of tractors.</p>
<p>Both on economic and on nutritional grounds we have revolted against
the commercial cereals and ordinary white flour. A small grist-mill, to
which we attached a motor from a discarded dishwasher, has made it
possible for us to grind our own flour, and to crack cereals for
breakfast foods. We have even managed to cut down the cost of the mash
we feed to our chickens by buying whole grains and grinding them
ourselves. That this simple piece of machinery should be in every
homestead can certainly be demonstrated on the basis of what it saves on
the cost of whole-wheat flour, which is the only kind we use.</p>
<p>We, of course, have had to buy our wheat. The wheat is, therefore,
our first cost. If wheat and oats and corn are grown on the homestead,
this would no longer be the first cost. First cost would be whatever we
had to spend in labor and money to raise the wheat. After paying for the
wheat, and adding the value of the labor and the cost of current and
similar expenses of operating our mill, our whole-wheat flour costs us
about 1 ½ cents per pound. Whole-wheat flour of the same quality now
sells in the grocery store for 6 ½ cents per pound. The difference
between the two is alone sufficient to make the investment in the
flour-mill pay us handsome dividends. But the saving on white flour is,
I believe, much greater, and consists of other savings than those
calculable in terms of money.</p>
<p>We use no white flour, except occasionally for pastry. White flour, I
believe, along with white sugar and white rice, is one of the most
harmful products for which we are indebted to the factory system. All
these bleached and whitened foodstuffs are made white by the mills which
produce them not only for the sake of their appearance, but in order to
preserve them during the long period of time which elapses between the
time when they are ground in the mill and the time they are consumed by
the public. Dentists will tell you that these white foods soften the
teeth; dietitians and doctors that they cause constipation. Personally,
I hold them suspect for the great white plague of tuberculosis.</p>
<p>White flour is only one of the three products into which wheat is
converted by our mills. The white flour we consume in bread and pastry;
the middlings are bleached and sold to us for breakfast food as Wheatena
of Cream of Wheat, and the bran is sold to us in neat packages to cure
us of the constipation which the white flour causes. Dr. Kellogg, of the
Battle Creek Sanitarium, who first hit on the bright idea of marketing
bran for this purpose, has made a fortune out of selling this by-product
of modern milling to the deluded American public. Yet as long as they
insist upon consuming white flour, the bran is an almost essential
purchase. All three of these products are present in the whole-wheat
flour we use, and which costs us about 1 ½ cents a pound. When we buy
wheat after it has been split into three parts by our milling industry,
we pay about 2 cents per pound for the white flour; about 13 cents per
pound for the middlings in the form of breakfast food, and 20 cents per
pound for the bran.</p>
<p>What is true of wheat is also true of corn. The home grist-mill makes
it possible for us to grind our own corn meal at a cost of about 1 ¼
cents per pound. But this is whole corn meal and not the pale ghost of
the old-fashioned corn meal of our grandmothers. Yet the desiccated
starchy substance which is now sold in our stores as corn meal costs 9
cents per pound. This corn meal is made from the dregs of whole corn
after the best part, the germ, has been cut out of it to be chemically
treated and turned into glucose and corn syrup. These chemical
substances in turn have replaced the honey, the maple sugar, the
molasses, and the brown sugar which were consumed in their places years
ago, and which it is still possible for each individual family to
produce for itself. Industrial production of these foodstuffs, instead
of representing progress, has resulted in furnishing us inferior food
and at a much higher price.</p>
<p>The American housewife tends constantly to buy more prepared or
partly prepared food, and to cook and preserve less and less in her
kitchen. After we moved to the country, the Borsodi kitchen showed an
exact reversal of the general trend. It was not only the room in which
we cooked or heated prepared foods for the table it became the family
cannery and packing-house and creamery. And in such a kitchen, we have
found that the average woman could earn much more than most of them were
earning in the factories, stores and offices for which so many millions
of women have abandoned home-making.</p>
<p>One of our first extravagances when we began to re-equip and redesign
our kitchen for production was the purchase of a steam pressure
cooker—price in 1920 $25. We justified this seeming extravagance with
the hope that it could be made into a profitable investment. Today
pressure cookers of the same size with many improvements over the type
we installed can be purchased for $8.50. This piece of domestic
machinery enabled the family to cut the labor of canning to from
one-quarter to one-third of that necessary with old-fashioned methods.
Its sterilization proved as reliable as any job of processing in the
largest canneries of the country. Without the pressure cooker, canning a
sufficient supply for winter would have been as great a labor for us as
trying to garden with a spade and hoe. With the pressure cooker it
became quite practical to put up four-hundred quarts of vegetables and
fruits an ample supply for a family of our size for the whole winter. In
addition to the staples usually canned, the pressure cooker enabled us
to can veal, chicken, mushrooms, and gelatine.</p>
<p>It made it possible for us to go into the winter with jar after jar
of delicacies such as chicken breasts, veal gelatine, and genuine mint
jelly. These cost us so little, aside from labor, which the pressure
cooker and the kitchen mixer reduced to a minimum, that we soon
abandoned the task of making detailed comparisons between the cost of
the home-made product and the high-priced and inferior canned goods we
formerly consumed.</p>
<p>As time went on we kept adding to the kitchen a good many appliances
which are usually considered luxuries. I have mentioned that we
purchased an electric range for use in the country. There was no gas
available on “Sevenacres”; to cook with oil seemed out of question,
while the old-fashioned kitchen range, however desirable in the winter,
made kitchens an inferno in summer. Our old electric range, which cost
us $75 ten years ago, was finally replaced by a $250 range a few years
ago—a range equipped with all the modern controls developed during that
period of time. But even here we refused to concede that we were going
in for luxuries; we were merely bringing our productive kitchen
machinery up to date. A test made at the time the new range was
installed confirmed us in our belief that the new range, the $200
kitchen mixer with all sorts of attachments, and the electric
refrigerator were all dividend-paying investments. Two complete meals
consisting of chicken, string beans, diced carrots, prunes, and
chocolate cakes were prepared by Mrs. Borsodi and a demonstrator sent up
by the General Electric Company, and served to a group of friends. One
of the meals was completely factory made from “boughten” products, with
nothing added in the kitchen except heat to the product as they came
from the packers, canners, and bakers. The total cost of this meal was
$3.46. The other was exactly the same as to menu but completely
home-made. After figuring the cost of materials at market prices,
electric current, investment on machinery and equipment, and making
allowance for the difference in the weight of the two meals, the total
cost of the home-made meal was $1.59—a saving of $1.87 on a single meal.
This proved a saving of $1.40 cents per hour for the time used in
cooking the meal—pretty good earnings in comparison with what most women
received in industry. Multiply such savings by the more than one
thousand meals which are eaten every year by the average family and it
is easy to see why we feel that a well-equipped kitchen is no luxury but
an absolute essential to the productive home.</p>
<p>It is, however, possible to stress the economic argument unduly. The
kitchen is not only a place in which the average woman can earn money.
It is even more one of the places in a home in which she can exercise
her creative and artistic faculties. Cookery is an art. It is one of
those arts much neglected today because we have so generally subscribed
to the fallacy that only that is art which has no utility.</p>
<p>But cookery is even more than art. It is science as well. The
chemistry of food is a fascinating subject. And if women but knew it,
health is more apt to be maintained by what is done by them in the
kitchen than by what all the doctors and druggists can do for their
families.</p>

<section id="the-loom-and-the-sewing-machine" class="level1">
<h1>The Loom and the Sewing-Machine</h1>
<p>When I first became interested in the possibilities of home weaving,
my father told me a story which I have told over and over again because
it illustrates most vividly the economic advantages of what I call
domestic production.</p>
<p>When he left his home in Hungary to come to this country he was
twenty-five years of age. That was not quite fifty years ago. At the
time he left Hungary the sheets which were in use in the family’s
ancestral home were the same sheets which had been included in the
hand-spun and hand-woven linens given to his mother as a wedding gift
thirty years before. What is more, at the time he left home they were
still in perfect condition and apparently good for a lifetime of further
service. After thirty years of continuous service those home-spun,
home-woven, home-bleached, and home-laundered sheets were still snowy
white, heavy linen of a quality it is impossible to duplicate today.</p>
<p>Now let us contrast the sheets which were in my grandmother’s home
with the sheets in our home today and in that of practically all of the
homes of industrialized America. Compared with the luxurious heavy linen
in my grandmother’s home, we use a relatively cheap, sleazy,
factory-spun, factory-woven and factory-finished sheet, which we used to
send out to commercial laundries, and which we replaced about every two
years. With domestic laundering they last about twice as long. True, the
first cost of our factory-made sheets is much less than the cost of the
hand-made linens, but the final and complete cost is much greater and at
no time do we have the luxury of using the linens which in my
grandmother’s home were accepted as their everyday due. I do not know
what her linen sheets cost in labor and materials fifty years ago. We
pay about $1.25 for ours, and on the basis of commercial laundering,
have to purchase new ones every two years. Our expenditure for sheets
for thirty years, with a family one-quarter the size of grandmother’s,
would therefore be $18.75 per sheet—much more, I am sure, than was spent
for sheets during the same period of time in my grandmother’s home. And
at the end of thirty years, we would have nothing but a pile of sleazy
cotton rags, while in the old home they still had the original sheets
probably good for again as much service.</p>
<p>Before the era of factory spinning and factory weaving, which began
with the first Arkwright mill in Nottingham, England, in 1768, fabrics
and clothing were made in the homes and workshops of each community. Men
raised the flax and wool and then did the weaving. Women did the
spinning and later sewed and knitted the yarns into garments of all
kinds. The music of the spinning-wheel and the rhythm of the loom filled
the land. Perhaps one-third of the time of men and women—one-third of
their total time at labor—was devoted to producing yarns and fabrics
which they consumed.</p>
<p>In the place of loom-rooms in its homes, America now has thousands of
mills employing hundreds of thousands of wage-earners. Many of the
wage-earners in these textile mills are children in spite of the
campaigns against child labor. And the wages paid by these mills are
notoriously the lowest which prevail in industry in this country.
Instead of healthy and creative work in the homes, we have monotonous
and deadly labor in mills.</p>
<p>A trifle over a third of the production of the cotton industry is
used for industrial purposes. It is used by manufacturers in fabricating
tires, automobile bodies, electric wire, and similar industrial
products. Two-thirds of the production of cotton and nearly all of the
production of the silk and wool industry goes to the consumer either as
piece goods for home sewing, or cut up into wearing apparel by clothing
manufacturers. This means that only 10-15% of the total number of
factories and workers in the entire industry are engaged in producing
for the needs of other industries. All of the rest are doing work which
used to be done in the home and much of which might still be done there.
And our experiments with sewing and weaving tend to show that it can be
done at an actual saving of labor or money.</p>
<p>If all the resources of modern science and industry were to be
utilized for the purpose of making the spinning-wheel, the reel, and the
loom into really efficient domestic machines (as efficient relatively as
is the average domestic sewing-machine), the number of textile-mills
which could meet the competition of the home producer would be
insignificant. And if modern inventive genius were thus applied to these
appliances for weaving, there would be no drudgery in domestic weaving;
a saving of time and money would be effected; the quality and design of
fabrics would be improved, and everybody of high and low degree would be
furnished an opportunity to engage in interesting and expressive work.
Such improved machinery would occupy no more space than is now wasted in
many homes and the loom-room would give to the home a new practical and
economic function.</p>
<p>Our loom, in spite of the attachment of a flying shuttle, which has
increased its efficiency greatly, remains one of the most primitive
pieces of machinery in our home. There is at present no really efficient
domestic loom upon the market. Most of the looms made for what is called
“hand weaving” with emphasis on the silent word “art,” are built upon
archaic models or devised so as to make weaving as difficult as possible
instead of as easy as possible.</p>
<p>The biggest market for these looms is, I believe, in the
institutional field. Weaving is one of the favored methods of
“occupational therapy” in the ever-increasing number of institutions for
nervous and mental disorders which we are erecting all over the country.
The strain of repetitive work in our factories and offices, and the
absence of creative and productive work in our homes, particularly for
women, children, and the aged, is turning us into a race of neurotics.
Weaving is being revived, after a fashion, as a therapeutic measure to
restore these unfortunates to health. What a ghastly commentary upon
what we have called progress. Having taken the looms out of homes during
the past century and transferred them to factories, we now find that the
absence of the creative work they used to furnish is producing an
ever-increasing number of neurotic men and women, and an endless number
of “problem” children. So our physicians are putting the loom into their
institutions in order to make the victims of this deprivation well
again. Then they turn them, after curing them, back into their loomless
homes to break down again.</p>
<p>The looms built for occupational therapy and hand-weaving generally
are deliberately designed to increase the amount of manual work which
those who operate them have to perform for every yard of cloth produced.
As a result the actual production of cloth is slow and laborious. Yet
there is no reason why this should be so. The right kind of loom would
enable the average family to produce suitings, blankets, rugs,
draperies, and domestics of all kinds of a quality superior to those
generally produced in factories and on sale in stores at a far lower
cost after taking time and all materials and supplies into
consideration. The artistic and emotional gains from the practice of
this craft would therefore be a clear gain.</p>
<p>In the average home, a loom which will weave a width of a yard is
sufficient. Ours is able to handle fabrics up to forty-four inches in
width. While many things can be made on a simple two-harness loom, we
find the four-harness loom a more useful type because of its greater
range of design. But every loom should be equipped with an efficient
system for warping, and with a flying shuttle, if it is to enable the
home-weaver to compete upon an economic basis with the factory. Neither
of these are expensive—in fact, the whole investment in equipment in
order to weave need not exceed $75 if one can make the flying-shuttle
arrangement oneself. The shuttle attachment on my loom was home-made and
took me only three or four hours to put together. With such a loom, even
an average weaver can produce a yard of cloth an hour—and a speedy
weaver, willing to exert himself, can produce thirty yards per day.
Since it takes only seven yards of twenty-seven-inch cloth to make a
three-piece suit for a man, it is possible to weave the cloth for a suit
in a single day on a small loom, and in less than a day on a loom able
to handle fifty-four-inch cloth.</p>
<p>Some idea of the possibilities of weaving, even without much
experience, can be gained from our first experiences with blankets one
was woven by a friend of mine who had never had any experience at all,
in a little less than eight hours. A similar one was the first blanket
woven by my son—a somewhat better piece of work—in less than six hours.
A third was a somewhat more elaborate affair on which three members of
the family each did a turn, and so I have no record of the time it took
to weave it. The yarn used in these blankets cost about $2.50 for each
blanket—at a time when blankets of similar quality couldn’t have been
purchased for many times that sum. Even if the loom is only used
occasionally, it will earn handsome dividends on the investment at this
rate.</p>
<p>Our experiments in the weaving of woollens for men’s and women’s
clothing have demonstrated the practicability not only of cutting out of
the budget most of the expenditures for ready-made garments, but even
the expenditures for fabrics. The accompanying illustrations of garments
made from fabrics woven in the Borsodi homestead suggest not only the
great variety of garments for which it is possible to weave the fabrics,
but the fact that they are, if anything, more attractive than those
which are usually on sale in retail stores ready-made.</p>
<p>The suit shown in the accompanying picture was made from yarn
home-spun in the Kentucky mountains; the cloth was woven and finished in
our home; the suit was made up by a tailor operating a one-man shop near
our place. The yarn cost $4.50; the tailoring $30. I had it appraised by
various so-called experts at the time, and they valued it all the way
from $60 to $90. One friend, who could not qualify as an expert but who
has his suits made by Fifth Avenue tailors, said that he had paid $125
for suits no better than this one. Incidentally, the suiting was the
first which I ever wove.</p>
<p>This matter of tailoring brings up one of the amusing follies of
modern civilization to which we pay no attention but for which we pay,
nevertheless, over and over again. The strictly tailored costumes which
men now wear have nothing but custom to recommend them. They require
great skill in sewing; they are therefore impractical for manufacture at
home. Yet they are artistic monstrosities. They do nothing to set off
the human form. They are not even utilitarian. Most of the hard work of
the world is done by men who wear over-alls or cotton garments which are
not tailored at all. While suits are practical enough for the work which
men do in offices, they are much too hot for indoor use—especially in
houses which are steam heated. A foolish convention, however, makes us
all wear them. If we, however, once again took the designing of our
garments into our own hands, it is possible that something much more
attractive and useful might develop. We might experiment with blouses,
or even with costumes such as the Chinese wear. And apropos of blouses
for men, it is an amusing commentary upon the industrialization of
Russian life under the Soviets, that the old Russian blouses, which
could be made in any household, are now being replaced by the
conventional costume of Western civilization—which has to be made in
factories.</p>
<p>With women’s garments, the field for weaving and for the
needle-crafts, even with prevailing styles, is much broader. The
garments illustrated show coats, suits, and dresses all made from
fabrics woven in our home. I presume I am rather prejudiced in the
matter, but it seems to me that the garments Mrs. Borsodi has produced
in our home compare favorably with those which most women buy ready to
wear today.</p>
<p>The sewing-machine is a most important piece of domestic machinery.
It is doubtful whether any other piece of machinery pays larger
dividends upon the investment made in it. Yet it remains a tool, to be
used when needed and laid aside, perhaps for months at a time, when no
sewing has to be done. In combination with the loom, the sewing-machine
takes on new significance both economically and artistically. What I
have here in mind can be made clear by quoting from an article by
Mrs. Borsodi in <em>The Handicrafter</em>, which describes one of her
suits:</p>
<p>The suit was made from a twill suiting. The yarn was a weaving
special; the warp tan No. 136, and the weft a lovely green, No. 755. The
weave was a simple twill made with four treadles operated 1, 2, 3, 4 and
repeat. Four yards of material 27 inches wide were used. The suit was
based upon a <em>Vogue</em> pattern, which was modified in many details.
Since I had never before tailored homespun, it took many more hours of
time to produce the suit than a second one could possibly take.
Immediately upon cutting the material by the pattern, I stitched twice
around the cut edges on the sewing-machine. This prevented the material
from unravelling. I then proceeded much the same as in making any other
coat and dress. Finally, after much pressing into shape, I have a suit
which has repeatedly been called very good-looking, and which I know
gave me more joy in the weaving and making than I ever had in purchasing
a similar product from any store. Outside of fur, it is the warmest coat
I have ever worn.</p>
<p>It is difficult to compare the cost with a factory product, because I
could not afford to purchase this quality and character of material made
up. To get this quality of material one would have to go to an expensive
house indeed, and to get this particular style of material at the time I
finished the suit, it would have been necessary to go to a stylish and
even exclusive house because it was just coming in. Taking all these
things into consideration, a valuation of $50 would represent a most
conservative price.</p>
<p>In judging the hours spent in weaving and sewing, please remember
that this was the first time I had done either, and, even on a second
garment of this type, the time of weaving and the time spent in sewing
could be considerably reduced. Also, I could make an even better-looking
suit a second time.</p>
<p>In charging fifty cents an hour for my time, I think I have given the
benefit of a relatively high rate to the factory, for few factories pay
this price for such operations as were performed. To be sure, the
factory has its designers who are well paid, but then I paid for my
share of such service in the <em>Vogue</em> pattern upon which I relied
for assured fit and style. And in addition to the saving on the suit, I
had the pleasure of developing a creation of my own.</p>

<p>It should be borne in mind that the above costs refer to a period
when prices were in general fully twice as high as they are today. Both
the cost above as well as the price of a garment with which to compare
this suit should therefore be understood as establishing relative
savings rather than actual savings today. The record, however, can stand
examination no matter from what standpoint it is viewed. It would show a
nice dividend upon the investment in domestic machinery even after full
allowance is made for the time spent in making the suit. It is
significant that the two yards of silk lining—purchased factory
made—cost almost as much as all the rest of the fabric for both
materials and weaving.</p>
<p>What the sewing-machine alone can do is shown from another record
from Mrs. Borsodi’s cost book. This covered an afternoon frock,
appraised at the time it was made as worth $49.50.</p>

<p>Some of the value in this frock lay, I presume, in its “style,”
something for which women pay a great deal if they are intent on keeping
on with the latest developments in Paris. The sewing-machine makes it
possible to secure style without having to patronize the most expensive
stores and to pay a premium for this service.</p>
<p>The coat shown on page 55 was made on the same warp as the man’s suit
previously referred to, but with a heavier weft. It cost about $3.50 in
yarn and about 24 hours for sewing and weaving. The fabric is a
distinctive herringbone effect; it is exceedingly warm; it promises to
wear almost indefinitely; the design and color express Mrs. Borsodi’s
personality. What more could be expected of any garment than that it
should be attractive, useful, inexpensive, and that its production
should furnish a creative outlet for the artistic abilities of its
maker?</p>
<p>To me the part which our loom and sewing-machine have played in
creative living is, if anything, more important than the service they
have rendered in making us less dependent upon earning money.</p>

<section id="shelter" class="level1">
<h1>Shelter</h1>
<p>For many years, shelter for us had meant the four walls of an
apartment in New York City with all the conveniences and services which
were included in the rent we paid. We took electricity and gas, running
hot and cold water, steam heat and modern plumbing, and janitor service,
quite for granted. It is true that a few years before our flight from
the city we had moved into a house in Flushing, a half-hour from the
center of the city. We then made the discovery that it was possible for
us to run a house and that we could have much more room, for the same
rent, if we were willing to burden ourselves with the responsibility for
producing our own hot water and our own heat in the winter. This
experience helped to get us into a frame of mind in which we could
seriously consider living in a house in the country in which there were
none of the comforts to which we were accustomed, until we installed
them and maintained them for ourselves. The purchase of a home in which
they were already present was out of question because our funds were too
small, and besides, that would have reduced the field in which we might
experiment with building and making things for ourselves.</p>
<p>The house on the place which we purchased when we moved to the
country twelve years ago—our present home is not on the same place—was
in part very old. Hewn timbers, fitted together with wooden pins, had
been used in the construction of one part of the building. The newer
section must have been added many years later, since the timbers were
regulation stuff. In addition, this new section must have at one time
been a separate building, because the ceilings in the two sections were
of different heights with the floor levels of the second story varying
correspondingly. The entrance was at one side of the house and the front
door decorated with a stupid little porch. Study of the lines of the
building led us to the conclusion that the door would have to be shifted
to the center and the window in the center moved to where the door was.
The front porch, we decided, was an anachronism which had no place in
our picture of the sort of house we wanted. At the back was a door which
for some unknown reason opened into the thin air with a sheer drop of
three feet to the ground. There were partitions inside where openings
should have been, and doors had been cut where there should have been
solid walls.</p>
<p>There was no electricity, no gas, no bathroom, no heating system.
There wasn’t even a fireplace, something for which we had romantically
hungered. The only thing approaching a convenience was an old-fashioned
hand suction pump in the kitchen connected to an iron sink. But we found
out that it didn’t work, and besides, that it was connected to a cistern
in which there was rarely any water.</p>
<p>To make this house over into what would furnish us the equivalent of
the comforts to which we were accustomed would have required the
employment of carpenters, of joiners, of plasterers, of plumbers, of
steam-fitters, of electricians.</p>
<p>To us these necessary alterations loomed up portentously. If the
house was to be made livable, all of them would have to be made, and
since we lacked the means to employ contractors to make all of them for
us, there was only one way out of the dilemma, and that was to undertake
to make most of them myself. An initial experience with contractors
helped to strengthen our determination in this direction. We had
purchased an electric range—price $75—for use in the country. We made
arrangements with an electrician to install the range the day after we
arrived, and received a bill for $35 for the work—nearly half the cost
of the range. Whether the charge was exorbitant or not, it seemed to us
high, and to me it did not seem to involve much in the way of skills
which I could not master.</p>
<p>I began to accumulate tools from that moment, and decided to train
myself for the job of jack-of-all-trades by undertaking to build
something on which my ’prentice hand could do no irretrievable damage. A
new chicken-house was elected. The shanty we had found on the place, and
which had been used for a chicken-house, was such a dirty, hopelessly
inefficient mess that it had to be torn down. With what could be
retrieved from the lumber in the old chicken-house and a few new
two-by-fours and boards, I began to build a chicken-house.</p>
<p>The building of that chicken-house proved a liberal education. If it
did not make me into a finished carpenter, it at least gave me the
courage to undertake the remodelling of the house, and eventually make
it over to something nearer to our idea of what a modest country home
should look like.</p>
<p>In the course of the year during which I spent all my spare hours
remodelling the house, building in cupboards and closets and furniture,
putting in electric lights, installing an automatic pumping system, I
acquired a wholesome confidence in my ability to work with tools. I
learned that deficiencies of experience and skill could be offset by the
time and pains put into each job. Before I was through with my building
operations on “Sevenacres,” I came to the conclusion that most of the
work which we think only skilled mechanics can do is quite within the
capacities of any intelligent and persevering man. While some of the
work which they do, and certainly the speed with which they can work,
requires years of experience, most of their skills involve relatively
simple techniques. The mysterious knowledge which makes the average city
man, in his ignorance, telephone for an electrician whenever a fuse
blows out or an electric-light fixture fails to function, and to hunt
for the janitor or call for a plumber when a faucet leaks, hasn’t the
right to be mysterious to anyone over the age of fifteen.</p>
<p>The effort to produce shelter for ourselves in this way produced a
number of dividends upon which we had not counted in the beginning. We,
of course, counted most upon reducing the cost of shelter. In the city,
a full quarter of our income had been spent for rent. By owning our
home, and above all by making our investment small because we were
willing to put some of our own labor into rebuilding, we cut down the
cost of shelter to not much more than I earned by one or two days’ work
a month. That left just so much more of what we used to spend for rent
available for other purposes than shelter; we had the income for from
four to five days more each month to save or spend.</p>
<p>One of the dividends upon which we had not counted was that of
health. We found that this sort of work, if it was not overdone (of
which there is a real danger when one’s enthusiasm is great), furnishes
wholesome and necessary exercise. And instead of being just the
mechanical exercise of gymnasium work, it is exercise for the intellect
and the emotions as well.</p>
<p>Another dividend was the discovery that building could be fun. Slowly
but surely the things we conceived first as an idea finally became
realities embodied in sticks and stones. The space where we decided that
a cupboard was needed was eventually occupied by one, and the cupboard
we dreamed and designed on a piece of paper eventually grew into a real
cupboard which served a functional purpose in our lives. The
satisfaction of standing off and looking at it when the last stroke of
the paint-brush had been laid upon it was emotionally much the same
thing felt by an artist when surveying a painting which he had finally
finished. The creative artist and the creative carpenter are brothers
under the skin. Creating and making things has its pains, no doubt, but
it has pleasures so great that they offset the pains.</p>
<p>One dividend upon which we had not counted was the discovery that the
right kind of machines often made up for the lack of skill—and the lack
of strength—of an inexperienced craftsman such as myself. A
concrete-mixer can furnish the strength for mixing sand and stone and
cement to a man who ordinarily never does any work heavier than shoving
a pen across the papers on a desk. And an electric saw can furnish him
the skill to make a square and plumb cut on a rafter which he might
never be able to acquire with a hand saw.</p>
<p>Out of this discovery grew our workshop, equipped with all sorts of
power-driven machines which furnished skill, supplied strength, and
saved labor. In spite of the fact that in my case I had to start with
zero in the way of experience in buying tools and machines, most of the
purchases made for the shop have proved to be paying investments. I use
the term workshop symbolically rather than geographically, for many
kinds of work are done and many of our tools are kept outside of the
workshop itself. Our shop now includes equipment for building with stone
and cement, for carpentry, for plumbing and steam-fitting, for
electrical wiring, for painting, and for heavier work such as hauling,
grading and excavating, pulling stumps, and even blasting. We ought to
have, but haven’t as yet, a forge and a lathe. When we install these
machines for metal-working we shall be able to do almost any job which
may develop in connection with the running and development of our
homestead.</p>
<p>This equipment wasn’t all purchased at once. It was acquired piece by
piece as necessity dictated and as our purse permitted. I never,
however, hesitated to buy a piece of machinery on credit or instalments
if I felt confident that it would pay for itself eventually out of its
savings. The concrete-mixer, for instance, was purchased when we decided
to build our new home of stone instead of wood. It has been used not
only to build one house, but four houses, and the last considerable job
for which it was used was the mixing of the concrete for our
swimming-pool. This was built almost wholely by our two boys, and but
for this piece of machinery and the tractor and scraper used in
excavating the ground, it would have been an impossible task for them.
The mixer has paid for itself over and over again, and it still stands,
old and battered, it is true, but ready for the same sort of service it
has furnished us in the past.</p>
<p>Another piece of machinery which served in many different ways was a
combination circular saw, planing-machine, and drill. These combination
machines are, on the basis of my experience, a mistake. Separate
machines are better in the long run, even though the investment in them
is somewhat greater. We have used the drill on this combination hardly
at all, and a separate band saw and separate planing-machine would be
better than the machine which we purchased. The band saw can handle
heavy timber as well as ordinary lumber, timbers for which the circular
saw is too small. Nevertheless we have used our saw machine on many
jobs, though it is now relegated mainly to the job of cutting wood for
our fireplaces and kitchen stove. Recently we managed to rig up an
attachment which enabled us to use a much larger saw on this machine,
and we have discovered that it is possible for us to rip boards up to
six inches in width out of logs grown in our own wood lot. In our
section of the country the blight has killed all the chestnut trees, and
we have quantities of this fine hardwood which we were burning until it
occurred to me that we might use this chestnut for making furniture. By
this coming winter we shall have accumulated a quantity of chestnut
lumber and shall then turn in earnest to furniture-making.</p>
<p>Our circular-saw machine was supplemented after a time with an
electric hand saw—one of the most useful tools on our place. It has
proved not only a great time and muscle saver, but has added immensely
to the skill of everyone who has used it. It takes a skilled carpenter
to make a perfectly square cut with a hand saw. The electric saw makes
it possible for any handy man to do an extremely workman-like job. And
of course when it comes to ripping boards, the speed with which it does
the work delights the heart.</p>
<p>An equally useful tool has been our electric hand drill. It has, for
one thing, almost relegated the brace and bit to limbo. We never use so
slow a tool except for holes too large for our electric drill. We use
this tool not only for drilling in wood and iron, but also for reaming
pipes, and sometimes for sharpening tools. We have other machines which
are not quite so often used—a sander, and a paint-machine, for example.
As all our houses are built of stone, we do not have much painting of
large surfaces with which to bother, so we have not the need of a
painting-machine which those who build of wood would have. Taking them
as a whole, these machines have made it possible for us to build up our
place steadily, and to add improvements during odd times which would
otherwise be wasted. It is largely because of these machines that we
have built four stone houses on our places—three residences and a stone
barn.</p>
<p>Our determination to build in stone dates back to discovery of Ernest
Flagg’s experiments in the building of attractive and economical small
houses. Flagg developed a system of building out of stone and concrete,
using forms in which to lay the walls, which greatly reduced the cost of
stone construction. Relatively unskilled labor could build Flagg walls
which were attractive, which were sound, and which were true. As a
result, we found ourselves building of stone—the natural building
material for a county with the name Rockland—at a cost not much higher
than that of good frame construction.</p>
<p>My enthusiasm for many of Flagg’s ideas has not abated. For instance,
he calls attention to the absurdity of cellars under houses built in the
country. The cellar usually represents a fifth of the cost of the house.
For much less money, the storage space ordinarily furnished by a cellar
can be provided by adding to the area of the building. Except where the
contour of the ground calls for a basement or cellar, all our houses are
built on what are virtually concrete platforms, over which the regular
floors have been laid.</p>
<p>Another idea of his has been the building of one-story houses,
without attics and with low walls, using dormers over doors and windows
to secure height where height is needed. This makes it possible to build
outside stone walls which are not more than four or five feet in height
for the most part, so that stone and concrete do not have to be carried
up to a considerable height and scaffolds erected on which to work. The
use of what he calls ridge dormers or ridge skylights makes it easy to
ventilate these one-story houses in summer.</p>
<p>But one of the things most attractive to me in Flagg’s type of
construction is the number of designs which can be built around courts,
section by section. This makes it possible to build a part of a house to
begin with, and add to it as means permit. When we started to build our
main house on the new place, we first finished one wing of the house,
and lived in it until the main part was finished. That took us over a
year. The whole house is not even now finished—nor do I see any reason
why it should ever be. A home, it seems to me, should grow like the
human beings it shelters. Building one’s shelter in this way, section by
section, made it much easier for us to finance the building of the sort
of home to which we aspired. And it should make it very much easier for
those who have not enough money at the beginning for all the home that
their vision paints for them.</p>

<section id="water-hot-water-and-waste-water" class="level1">
<h1>Water, Hot Water, and Waste Water</h1>
<p>The great adventure, on which we had embarked when we left the city,
did not contemplate any return to primitive ways of life.</p>
<p>We had no intentions of going in for manual labor just for the sweet
discipline of hard work. We had no intention, therefore, of being
satisfied with drawing water hand over hand from a well—a laborious form
of drudgery still prevailing on many of the farms of the country. And
certainly we had no romantic notions about carrying water from a flowing
brook—good enough for a camping trip, but ridiculous as a permanent way
of living. We were not after any such return to nature. What we wanted
were all the comforts of the city in addition to the comforts which
country life had to offer. There would be enough hard work, we knew,
without making a virtue of doing things the hardest way.</p>
<p>The water supply on “Sevenacres” when we purchased it came from a
well about twenty-five feet from the kitchen door, and from a cistern
fed by rain water from the eve troughs of the house. Water was drawn
from the well by two oak buckets on chains which were pulled up over a
pulley. A suction pump in the kitchen was supposed to draw water from
the cistern. This pump was out of order, but after being repaired, in
the course of which we all received our first lesson in applied
hydraulics, we discovered that this was a most uncertain source of
water, since the cistern was too small to carry a supply between most
spells of wet weather. So we installed an automatic electric pumping
system—an outfit which at that time represented an investment of $125
but which can now be purchased for around $50. With the services of a
plumber to connect it up, an expenditure of $150 put running water into
the house.</p>
<p>What did it cost us for water? Did it cost us more than in the city,
where we had the benefits of mass pumping and mass distribution through
water mains? On “Sevenacres” I had no occasion to work out this problem,
but when we dug our well and installed our pumping system on the
“Dogwoods,” I decided to find out, and kept records, so that at the end
of a number of years I would be in position to answer the question with
some degree of accuracy.</p>
<p>Some years after we were living in our new home I had quite an
argument with my friend, Ralph W. Hench, who lives in Suffern, upon this
point. The Hench family, of course, enjoyed the luxury of city water.
Water cost them, he told me, $20 per year. And he was quite certain that
mine cost me much more than that. There was no man better equipped than
Hench with whom to argue the point, since he was in charge o the
accounting for one o the largest corporations of the country, and the
question could only be correctly answered if approached from an
accounting standpoint.</p>
<p>We made a detailed calculation of what it had cost us to supply
ourselves with water on the “Dogwoods” during the seven years we had
lived there. The capital investment in our system was as follows:</p>
<table>

</tbody>
</table>
<p>The labor costs are, if anything, high, since I was my own contractor
and only unskilled labor was used. These figures are too high according
to present-day price levels. Our outfit can probably be duplicated for a
third less than it cost us. Not only have prices come down owing to the
depression, but technological advances in pump manufacture, motors,
tanks, fittings, etc., have brought down costs materially.</p>
<p>We then projected costs upon an annual basis as follows:</p>

<p>The moment we had these figures my friend exclaimed: “There you
are—it is costing you over twice as much as it costs me in Suffern.”</p>
<p>I went to the telephone and called up a mutual acquaintance who we
both agreed was the best judge of realty values in Suffern, and asked
him this question: “Suppose there were two lots for sale in Suffern,
both of them equally desirable in every respect except one. Suppose one
of them was located on the Suffern water system, and suppose the other
was located where no water could be supplied to the owner by the city.
What would the difference in the price of the two lots be?”</p>
<p>After considering the matter a moment, he replied, “About
$500—perhaps a little more or a little less.” Then I started out to
figure what it cost my friend Hench for water in Suffern. And these were
the figures at which we finally agreed:</p>
<div class="line-block">Item | Cost |<br />
Interest on capital of $500 at 6% | $30.00 |<br />
Taxes on added land value—3.2% of the $250 assessment | $8.50 |<br />
Water tax | $20.00 |<br />
Total cost | $58.00 |</div>
<p>This showed a clear saving of $12.81 per year in favor of the
individual pumping system. “But I am not through yet,” I said. “This
figure of $58,” I went on, “represents what it costs for water in
Suffern on a single lot. But many homes in Suffern are built upon two or
more lots, thus doubling the initial investment, and correspondingly
raising the hidden cost of securing water from the city mains. While if
there were eighteen acres of land around a home, as there is around
mine, the cost of water would be prohibitive for any but the wealthiest
of families.”</p>
<p>Here with regard to water we have another of the many illustrations
available of the mistaken idea that mass production is of necessity
economical. With water, as with other conveniences and with most
products, what is saved by mass production tends to be lost in the costs
of distribution. It undoubtedly costs the city of Suffern less to pump
water than it costs me in the country. My small and relatively
inefficient pumping system cannot hope to compete in cost per gallon of
water raised with the large and relatively efficient pumping system of a
city of many thousands of people. But when I pump my water on the
“Dogwoods,” all costs in connection with water end. When the city pumps
its water, its real costs of supplying water only begin. It is the cost
of distributing the water through an expensive system of water-mains
which absorbs the economies of the “mass” pumping, and replaces them
with an actual higher cost than that of the individual homesteader. The
city’s investment and operating costs for its pumping system are
negligible in comparison with its investment and maintenance costs for
its water-mains. The pumping costs are taken care of by the water tax,
but the distribution costs are hidden in higher land values, except
right when the mains are laid when they are made visible in the form of
assessments against the lots before which they have been laid.</p>
<p>What is true of water is true of many of the public services which
are enjoyed by those living in cities today. Just as mains are laid to
distribute water, sewers are laid to assemble waste water. The two
functioned for us in the city without our being hardly conscious of the
fact. If we were to be equally comfortable in the country, we would have
to solve the waste-water problem as we had that of running water.</p>
<p>A decent sewage-disposal system is unquestionably one of the
essentials of a civilized existence. I can see nothing charming in the
way in which this problem is handled by savages in a so-called state of
nature, and the way in which it is handled in most country homes today,
with uncomfortable and sometimes unsanitary outhouses, seems to me but
little better. When we began to study this problem, we found, as we had
with so many others, that the benefits of a modern sewage-disposal
system could be enjoyed in the country without the expense of paying for
maintaining the sewers and sewage-disposal plants for the operation of
which city dwellers pay such an unconscionable sum. Looked at from its
broadest standpoint, the system generally used today involves a shocking
waste of the nation’s soil resources. It is no exaggeration of the
actual situation to say that we are now taking up organic material from
the soil, converting it into foodstuffs, and then destroying that
organic matter irretrievably with fire and chemicals in the sewage
disposal plants of our cities.</p>
<p>In studying this problem, we became aware of the fact that we had, in
common with others who enjoyed the benefits of city life, paid for
sewage disposal even though we had been unaware of the fact. Unless the
city man happens to own his own home—and the vast majority do not—he has
no direct knowledge of what taxes are paid for. All he knows is that he
pays rent. The fact that part of his rent really pays for running water,
for sewage, garbage and ash disposal, is hardly realized by him, just as
when he lives in an apartment he forgets that another substantial part
of his rent really pays for heat, hot water, janitor service and all the
conveniences of his apartment. What we discovered was that we could have
practically every service of this sort essential to our comfort, without
having to pay a premium price for them.</p>
<p>A simple and inexpensive septic tank, with a drainage tile system to
dispose of the overflow from the tank, is all that is needed in order
not only to dodge the heavy cost of sewage disposal in the city, but for
converting the waste into a contribution to soil fertility. What is
taken from the soil is then returned. After we installed such a system
on our place in the country, the sewage problem vanished for us.</p>
<p>Hot water, and plenty of it, is necessary to comfort by present
standards of living. In the apartment houses in which we used to live we
secured our supply from the hot-water taps in seemingly unlimited
quantities. We were determined to solve the problem of producing it for
ourselves with practically no labor and at a lower cost than we had paid
for it in the city—concealed inside the rent we had paid each month.</p>
<p>It is almost impossible to be clean without a plentiful supply of
really hot water. For dish-washing, water which is merely lukewarm is an
irritation rather than a comfort. Yet in spite of the fact that plenty
of hot water is essential to comfort, millions of homes in America still
depend upon such primitive methods as tea-kettles and side-arm-stove
heaters for their supply of hot water.</p>
<p>The tea-kettle, we found, furnishes some really hot water, if the
fire under it is always a brisk one. But the quantity which can be
heated is hardly enough for the needs of the kitchen alone. And of
course it requires dozens of trips back and forth filling the tea-kettle
with water and emptying the hot water into the vessel in which it is to
be used. The labor and strength involved in making these trips may seem
trifling, but repeated dozens of times daily, it totals up to a
surprising amount of time and a considerable amount of fatigue, for
neither of which there is any real necessity. Modern offices and
factories are efficient just in proportion to the extent to which they
eliminate all such wastes of time and strength. There is no reason why
our homes should be run at lower standards of efficiency. And such
efficiency pays in dollars as well as in happiness.</p>
<p>Every bit of time and strength saved from unnecessary
labor—especially non-creative labor such as that involved in cleaning,
carrying water, washing, and similar work—frees an equivalent amount of
time and strength for productive and creative work. Some of
Mrs. Borsodi’s friends wonder how she, even with the assistance of
servants, gets the time to do the quantities of cooking, baking,
preserving, sewing, and even weaving which go on in her home. By using
labor-saving appliances and machines to eliminate as much non-productive
work as possible, time is saved which can be used to produce these
things. An investment in an efficient water-heating system, for
instance, which eliminates the non-productive work of carrying water
back and forth, pays for itself over and over again by what it enables
the family to save in making things which it would otherwise have to
buy. It is for this reason that the tea-kettle method of producing hot
water seems to us as obsolete as the Dutch oven. It doesn’t pay. It not
only is unequal to the requirements for hot water in bathing; it makes a
supplementary method of heating absolutely essential for laundering. And
we have found doing our own laundry at home is one of the easiest ways
in which to pay for an efficient system of hot-water heating.</p>
<p>We started to get away from the tyranny of the tea-kettle with a
small coal heater in the cellar. Water was piped from it to a storage
tank, and from the tank to the various hot-water faucets. This was an
inexpensive installation, and furnished a good supply of hot water
without too much expense. The fire, however, had to be attended to
several times each day, and the ashes carried out periodically.</p>
<p>In an effort to get rid of this labor we installed a kerosene heater.
The first one we tried out was wickless. Our kerosene was evidently not
clear enough for this type of heater, and the burners frequently
crusted, thus interfering with its efficiency as well as creating an
unpleasant cleaning job. True, we had a plentiful supply of hot water;
the cost, however, was a little higher than coal, and we still had the
unpleasant chore of filling the oil-reservoir daily and cleaning the
heater occasionally.</p>
<p>Next we tried a kerosene heater with wicks. This proved an
improvement in one respect only—if we changed the wicks frequently
enough we avoided the unpleasant cleaning job with which we had to
struggle before. We still had the daily filling of the oil-tank on our
hands—so the job was still by no means automatic.</p>
<p>Finally we decided to go in for a completely automatic installation.
A very low rate permitted us to install an electric heater on an
off-peak rate. Where the power company has established such a rate, this
type of heater is economical and efficient, and it requires no attention
whatever. The off-peak rate is still a new idea; in many cases
completely automatic hot water can be most inexpensively secured with
gas. In country homes not reached by the mains of a gas company,
portable gas-tanks can be used and while the cost is higher, it is
still, in our judgment, not so different from ordinary gas as to warrant
some of the methods which we discarded.</p>
<p>Our experiments with the various methods of heating water, as with
other domestic appliances, have thoroughly convinced us that the
investment and cost of maintaining the most efficient means for
furnishing the home with utilities and comforts are quite within the
income limitations of most families in this country. It may not be
possible to install all of these comforts in the very beginning, any
more than we were able to, but they are distinctly economical if the
time which they save is used for productive work in reducing and
eliminating butcher, baker, grocer, and clothier bills.</p>

<section id="educationthe-school-of-living" class="level1">
<h1>Education—The School of Living</h1>
<p>When we were considering shaking the dust of the city from our feet,
the school question was one which caused us a great deal of worry. Our
boys were seven and eight years old; they had been going to school from
the time they had entered the kindergarten classes in the city’s public
schools. At the time we were planning to leave the city they had already
made more scholastic progress than other children of their age; one was
a half-year ahead, and the other a full year ahead, of their
chronological age. The credit for this, we now know, was due less to the
elaborately organized public schools of New York City than to our use at
home of some of the methods of child-training developed by Dr. Maria
Montessori, the Italian educator, in whose theories the country was just
then becoming interested. We had used the Montessori methods from the
moment the boys were old enough to start feeding and dressing
themselves. So impressed were we by her approach to the problem of child
education that we constructed our own “didactic” apparatus because none
of it was at that time on sale in this country.</p>
<p>Without having pushed our boys, but merely by giving them a chance to
take advantage of the opportunities which the schools offered them, they
were making excellent progress. Now we were committing ourselves to a
way of living which would take them away from the educational advantages
of city schools. Should we risk what would happen to them in one of the
“little red schoolhouses” which still abounded in 1920 in New York
State? If we were confronted by such an emergency, would we prove equal
to teaching them at home? We decided we would. When I compared
Mrs. Borsodi to the average school-teacher in the public schools, I saw
no reason why she could not teach the children just as well, if not
better, at home. She might lack the technique for handling a large
class, and she might not have been drilled in the syllabus required by
the state Board of Regents, but when it came to individual instruction,
I was confident that she could do more for the children than could
public schools, no matter how well managed. When we finally got to the
country, our worst expectations were realized. The school in our
district was impossible. The school board consisted of “old-timers”
whose principal concern was to keep the tax rate down. Not only were the
teachers which the board selected unequal to their responsibilities, but
the social and moral atmosphere was bad. In that respect it was worse
than the city. There at least the contacts of our boys with children
whom we considered undesirable were limited. And the number of children
made it possible to select only those for companionship of whom we
approved. In a small school, such as that with which we had to contend,
the damage which the bullies or perverts are able to do is all out of
proportion to the damage which they can do in a large one. The situation
in our district, and I believe in the country generally, has in the past
decade shown great improvement. The coming of the school bus has made it
possible to eliminate most of the impoverished one-room schools, and in
the large consolidated schools which have taken their place, city
conditions of school organization are to a large extent duplicated.</p>
<p>We first tried cooperation with the school board and with the
teachers. Most of the board members proved impossible. When we talked
about educational problems to them, we found ourselves talking in a
foreign tongue. The teachers were, in general, not quite so hopeless; at
least they knew what we were talking about. But most of them were
immature; most of them had been more or less ruined by the rigid
regimentation which the state required of them. We did manage to win the
cooperation of the first teacher to whom the boys were turned over, and
as long as she was in charge of the school she tried to make the
conventional scheme work. But the next teacher resented bitterly our
interest, and reluctantly we decided that this method of trying to make
the country school endurable was love’s labor lost.</p>
<p>We finally decided to take the boys out of school altogether.</p>
<p>A talk with the county superintendent of education won his
cooperation. In fact, he decided that the sort of education our boys
would receive under the plan we outlined would more than meet the
requirements of the law. Our plan was to use the regular textbooks, to
follow the state procedure in teaching as laid down in the syllabus of
each subject, and to have one of the public-school teachers who lived in
the neighborhood come in once each month to put the boys through an
examination which would insure their finishing up each year precisely as
well as did the boys attending public school. This plan, we believed,
would prepare them for high-school even though they had none of the
“benefits” of class work for a few years.</p>
<p>Thus began our experiment in domestic education. And again,
individual production proved its superiority to mass production.
Mrs. Borsodi found it possible to give the boys, in two hours’ desk
work, all the training which they were supposed to get, according to the
state, in a whole school day plus the work which they were supposed to
do at home. One of her first discoveries was that the training of the
boys on such sheer fundamentals as addition, subtraction,
multiplication, and division had been so poor that mathematical progress
and understanding were almost impossible. She made the boys retrace
their steps. Some conscientious drilling on the A, B, Cs, and they were
then able to gallop through the more difficult parts of arithmetic.
Working closely with them, she knew whether or not they really
understood. She did not have to rely upon an examination to find out—an
examination which revealed little to the teacher because of its
mechanical limitations. Two hours of such study, I agreed with
Mrs. Borsodi, were sufficient for the sort of thing upon which the
public schools concentrated; the rest of the day would prove of more
educational value to the boys if devoted to reading and play. The play,
in such a home, was just as educational as the reading. Productive and
creative activities in the garden, the kitchen, the workshop, the
loom-room furnished the boys opportunities to “play” in ways since
adopted as regular procedure by the progressive schools. In our home,
however, such play was directly related to useful functions; they were
not merely interesting exercises.</p>
<p>Best of all, the new scheme furnished plenty of time for reading. The
reading seemed to us all important. One of the terrible things which the
average school does to its pupils is to kill their love for books. All
books, to the child who has had to “read” in class, tend to become
textbooks. The poetry, plays, novels, essays which are parts of their
courses in English are read, not to furnish rich experiences and to
expand the imagination, but as subjects for recitation and grammatical
analysis. This is a process which dissects what should be a living
thing, and the corpse of a poem which the child is made to study is no
more what the artists who created it intended it to be than the corpse
which medical students dissect is a living, breathing human being. The
reading of <em>Ivanhoe</em> was a part of the prescribed course of
English in the public school during the years they attended the district
school. They were required to read in class a paragraph at a time daily.
The idea horrified me. So I suggested that they read the whole story
through at home without regard to their class work. The result more than
pleased me. The boys discovered that <em>Ivanhoe</em> was a fascinating
story; one of them read it through several times before tiring of it.
Instead of hating the story, they learned to love it.</p>
<p>As a result of our insistence upon the fact that reading was fun,
rather than work, books came to play naturally the part in their lives
which they should play in every educated person’s existence. Their
imaginations were broadened; the provincialism of city and country so
prevalent today became impossible to them; even the textbooks acquired,
by sympathetic magic, an entirely different significance from that which
they develop in schools. Instead of consisting of lessons to be
memorized in preparation for “exams,” they were found to be keys to the
accumulated knowledge of mankind. We found, however, that the
Encyclopaedia Britannica was better for this purpose than all their
textbooks put together.</p>
<p>Most parents will probably shrink from considering such an
undertaking because of the amount of time they believe they would have
to devote to it. But such a supposition is a mistaken one. It really
does not take much time. We have acquired our notions about the number
of hours children should study daily from the amount of time which they
usually spend in school. There is a dreary waste o time inescapable in
the process of mass education. Most of the time of the children in
public schools is devoted to waiting, not studying. Studying of a sort
is prescribed as a means of filling in the time devoted to waiting. The
children wait in classes, and they wait between classes. Occasionally
there is an educational contact between teacher and pupil. In between
these contacts, the children are kept out of mischief by an amazingly
ingenious series of time-filling exercises. What I consider an
educational contact is usually a fortunate accident in our conventional
schools. Education is the exception, not the rule, because only when a
child feels a need for information and explanation, and feels it
emotionally and intellectually and not mechanically, is that educational
contact established. Mostly when these needs develop in the lives of
school children, the routine of the schoolroom prevents the teacher from
responding to it, and the hunger is dissipated and replaced by
boredom.</p>
<p>Our experience showed that in such a home as we were establishing
these opportunities abounded. Education was really reciprocal; in the
very effort to educate the boys, we educated ourselves. Indeed, it is a
notion of mine that no real educational influence is exerted upon the
pupil unless there is also an incidental educational effect upon the
teacher. The average public school is operated upon the theory that this
personal relationship is unwise; that the relationship should be
impersonal, objective, and mechanical, the example of Socrates and the
peripatetic school to the contrary notwithstanding.</p>
<p>With our method, we not only managed to avoid the handicap of a poor
school, but the whole Borsodi family seemed to be going to school. But
it proved to be a school so different from that to which most of us have
become accustomed that I have had to invent a special name for it—the
school of living.</p>
<p>In this school the members of the family, old and young, and those
who have lived with us, have been both faculty and students. The subject
which they studied has been <em>living</em>, the pedagogic system has
been what might be called the <em>work-play</em> method, the textbooks
have been anything and everything printed which touched upon the
problems of the good life in any way. The absence of formality in this
school may deceive the uninitiated, and the fact that a systematic
educational activity is going forward may be overlooked. For that reason
I once put down the various projects which have in one way or another
been the subjects of our study, and found that they formed a fairly
comprehensive curriculum falling into four major divisions—Art and
Science, Management, History, Philosophy.</p>
<p>Philosophy is a subject remote and distant from life as it comes to
most people in school. Yet there is no reason why it should be. We need
desperately philosophy as a guide to life. We need it as a tool with
which to train thought—logic for everyday use. But we need it also to
form values and habits. We need for every-day living (1) economic
policies, (2) physiological, (3) social, (4) biological, (5)
psychological habits; and (6) religious, (7) moral, (8) political (9)
educational, (10) individual values. Why should we not approach the
practical questions which fall under these various academic
classifications from a philosophic point of view? Yet as a matter of
fact we make most of our decisions—or acceptances of decisions made by
others—with utter disregard of their philosophic implications.</p>
<p>History is another subject which undergoes a transformation when it
too is domesticated. History really has three aspects with us: (1)
past—which is the aspect to which it is usually confined; (2) current
history—to which the schools have only in recent years awakened; and (3)
future history, which is to me most important of all. We have to make
plans, we have to adopt policies, we have to determine values—but these
cannot be formulated wisely unless one projects past and present into
the future. Yet there is scarcely a day in our lives when such planning
might not be made to add immensely to our comfort and happiness if it
were approached from a historical standpoint.</p>
<p>Art and science—sundered by the specialists into whose care their
study has been intrusted by our schools—need to be brought together in
selecting and preparing food, in designing clothes and costumes, in
building and furnishing our homes. We need more chemists in our
kitchens, and fewer in our laboratories; just as we need more artists in
them and fewer in our large advertising agencies. Every single step in
practical living has both its artistic and its scientific aspects, and
we do not live richly unless we bring to bear upon these apparently
humble and yet all-important living problems all the accumulated wisdom
and skill of the ages.</p>
<p>Finally, we need to study management—the management of living, not of
business. We have management problems as individuals, as families, as
civic groups—why should we not apply to home problems the care and
thought and attention which we now bestow upon production, purchasing,
marketing, and finance in business? Every family has to finance itself;
every family has purchasing of many kinds to carry on—and how poorly
that is done only those familiar with Consumers’ Research can realize;
every family markets services or produce, and practically every family
produces more or less in its kitchens, sewing-rooms, gardens. Under the
scheme of living with which we have been experimenting, domestic and
individual production becomes so immeasurably more important, that study
of it is essential if it is to be efficiently carried on.</p>
<p>Here are most of the subjects taught in our schools and universities,
but in a new guise. As we have studied them they are not subjects so
much as essential parts of the whole problem of living. In the schools,
specialization and the division of labor among the teachers, and
preparation for a life of specialization and the division of labor among
the students, has led to the isolation of each particular subject. In
the intense concentration upon each narrow field, the relationship of
each subject to life as a whole is distorted and the true significance
of what is studied is obscured. We ought, for instance, to study
chemistry in order that we may live more richly; instead, we live in
order to develop and promote and expand chemical activity and chemical
industry. Means and ends are thus reversed, just as in our factories
today men and women take it quite for granted that it is sane to devote
their lives to the production of something to be sold or marketed,
instead of devoting the best part of each day to the creation or
production of something which enriches their own lives.</p>
<p>In nothing is the present-day mistakes of educational institutions
more apparent to me than in the separation of art and science into
separate, air-tight, and mutually opposed specialities. We have not only
separate teachers and separate courses—we have separate schools for the
arts and for the sciences, with not a little contempt on the part of
each group for those devoting themselves to the other. As a result, we
are busily producing artists who are ignorant of science, and engineers
who are ignorant of art. If beauty and richness be considered the ends
and objects of living, and the scientific and engineering techniques the
means for attaining this end, then we are actually producing painters,
writers, sculptors, poets who are supposed to specialize on the ends or
objects of living, and scientists, engineers, chemists who are taught
the means but not the ends to be attained. The result is a sterile art,
divorced from life, and a meaningless multiplication of sky-scrapers,
subways, sewers, dams, bridges, and engineering works of all kinds.</p>
<p>In the homely things of life, so important in the aggregate, this
separation of art and science is now almost universal. For instance,
take such a homely thing as bread—the staff of life. Bread ought to be
nutritious and it ought to be tasty. One without the other is an
absurdity. Yet we have chemists in our universities studying bread
scientifically. They produce all sorts of facts about vitamins, about
fermentation, about nutrition. And then we have, even today, many
housewives baking bread and governing their approach to the problem
primarily by taste. The one sees bread as an object, scientifically; the
other sees it as a flavor much as might an artist. Because of the
housewife’s ignorance of science, she may ruin her family’s health;
because of the scientist’s ignorance of art, bread is produced which is
unfit for consumption by cultivated palates. Of the two, the scientist
may actually do more harm than the housewife, though it is hard to be
certain about the matter. At least the housewife’s bread may taste well
and so add to the pleasures of the table, but the scientist may reduce
eating to the level of stoking a boiler.</p>
<p>Some day I hope a group of intelligent and cultured people may find
it worth while to establish such a school of living. Such a school, if
it included enough families to determine really what is the good life
experimentally, would furnish a demonstration of how to live to which
the whole world might listen. Such a group would demonstrate that it is
possible for men and women to make themselves independent and
economically secure, and that centering educational activities directly
upon the problems of living would add immeasurably to mankind’s
happiness and comfort.</p>
<p>The world is badly in need of such a demonstration. All that the
Borsodi family has thus far managed to do has been to show how badly it
is needed.</p>
</section>
<section id="capital" class="level1">
<h1>Capital</h1>
<p>Just what to say about the capital needed to establish a homestead is
one of the most difficult matters with which I find that I have
undertaken to grapple. Yet it is one question about which I am asked
more frequently than almost any other by those who express a liking for
the way of living with which the Borsodi family has been experimenting.
Before attempting to deal with the matter, however, I think it important
to dispel an illusion under which many people who have heard about our
experiment seem to labor. Typical of these people is one man, connected
with one of our agricultural schools, who assumed that because the
houses, land, machinery, and livestock comprising our homestead
represented an investment of at least $15,000 (according to his
estimate), that therefore the capital with which I began the experiment
must have been $15,000. “With $15,000,O he wrote me,”I would not need
such a homestead in order to make myself independent. Invested in stocks
and bonds, that sum would furnish a comfortable living without going to
all the trouble of producing everything for one’s own use on a small
farm. For most people who desire independence and security the problem
is how to get the $15,000 not what to do with it after they get it.”</p>
<p>It is an interesting commentary upon the tenacity with which even
intelligent people maintain conventional illusions that such a letter
was written to me after the collapse of the securities market in 1929.
In spite of the collapse of the houses of cards which buyers of
securities everywhere were discovering they had erected for themselves,
this man still believed that dependence upon investments in stocks and
bonds was superior to dependence upon a homestead equipped with
livestock, tools, and machinery with which a family could produce a
plentiful living for themselves no matter what happened to the business
world. If the depression should have taught him anything, it should have
made him sec that stocks and bonds furnish no one real security. The
only possible security in our present chaos is direct access to the
opportunity to produce for oneself the essentials of a comfortable
living.</p>
<p>But even if it were true, as my friendly critic believed, that there
were such things as <em>secure</em> securities, the point remains that
in the beginning there was no $15,000 invested in the Borsodi homestead.
Certainly I was never confronted with the alternative of investing
$15,000 in stocks and bonds or of investing it in a homestead. Yet it is
true that today, after twelve years of slow growth, the homestead does
represent a large investment, an investment much greater than the sum at
which this critic valued it. It is the way in which we started out to
live, not the fact that we had the capital before we left the city,
which explains our possession today of a fairly well-equipped home. If
one can lay hands upon just enough with which to start, then a $15,000
homestead should come ultimately by the sheer development which such a
way of living makes possible.</p>
<p>The question, therefore, is not how to secure $15,000, but how to
secure enough with which to start. And enough with which to start can be
saved by many families, I maintain, in spite of the inequalities and
injustices of our present social system. How much, then, is really
needed in the beginning? That depends in most cases on two things: what
sort of income from “jobs” the family can depend upon while it is
establishing itself, and how much it is willing to endure in the way of
hardships for the first year or two. If the income is an average “white
collar” salary, hardships can be quickly eliminated. If the income is
very much smaller, the original investment must be larger or the family
must be willing to endure a rather Spartan regime until the equipment
for producing the comforts of country life is gradually purchased. Our
own experience illustrates the principles involved.</p>
<p>When we left the city, we had as capital only the small savings which
we had managed to accumulate in spite of the “accidents” which
periodically prevent savings accounts from growing as they theoretically
should. In addition, I had a salary of $50 per week—not a very high one
for the post-war period. We purchased a place for $4,000, paying down
$500, and arranged to pay off the balance in monthly installments of
$50. This was smaller than the rent of $65 we had been accustomed to pay
in the city even when interest and taxes are included. After paying for
our place we found ourselves with hardly enough cash on hand to move and
get settled in the new place. We did invest $75 in the electric range.
But all purchases of livestock, of tools, of labor-saving comforts, had
to come out of income. Two things, however, made that income go farther
in equipping the homestead than might at first be anticipated. One was
that since we spent less than we had in the city for rent and for food,
even the first year, we had more money with which to make investments in
equipment than we would ordinarily have saved out of salary. The other
was that the investments in the more expensive equipment could be made
on the installment plan. One month, for instance, we made all the
purchases for our poultry-yard—incubator, eggs and setting hens. The
next month we purchased our steam pressure cooker—which cost $25 at that
time. Such purchases we made for cash out of what we saved from week to
week. When it came to installing our automatic pumping system—an
investment which ran into hundreds of dollars—we purchased it on the
installment plan and had the satisfaction of seeing it save us enough to
pay for itself month by month.</p>
<p>Yet in spite of the relatively small initial investment and the
modest income in the beginning, and in spite of periods of no income or
little income after I quit my job to write my first book, the homestead
grew steadily and came more and more to represent that large investment
which so chilled my skeptical critic. Eventually income began to go up
as I cut down the time I devoted to earning money, or perhaps it would
be more accurate to say I was able to secure more for my time as I
became less and less dependent upon those to whom I sold my services.
That made the development of the place just that much easier, and made
it possible for us to start building the “Dogwoods” and to equip it as
experience had taught us such a homestead should be equipped. This
possibility of earning more, by needing to work less, is cumulative and
is open to an immense number of professional workers. It is remarkable
how much more appreciative of one’s work employers and patrons become
when they know that one is independent enough to decline unattractive
commissions. And of course, if the wage-earning classes were generally
to develop this sort of independence, employers would have to compete
and bid up wages to secure workers instead of workers competing by
cutting wages in order to get jobs.</p>
<p>That it is possible to start homesteading with even less than the
Borsodi family started was demonstrated to my satisfaction by the
studies I was retained to make by the Unit Committee of the Dayton,
Ohio, Council of Social Agencies in connection with the establishment of
homesteads for the unemployed of that city. These victims of the machine
age had nothing in the way of income other than part time or odd jobs,
and what they were making for their own needs through their Production
Units. They had no capital at all with which to start, except the things
they had managed to hang on to in the way of furniture, utensils, and
personal belongings. Plans had, therefore, to be made, first to
establish them on homesteads at the minimum of possible investment, and
then to furnish them some sort of cash income to meet the expenses for
things which they would not be able to produce for themselves. Part-time
work for others in business or industry or professional life, and the
sale of surplus produce, was expected to furnish an income equivalent to
one or two days’ work per week for at least one member of the family.
With an income of between five and ten dollars per week, I estimated the
homesteaders would be able to repay the advances made to them for
investment in the homestead and its equipment, meet all ordinary
expenditures for taxation, light, fuel, transportation, and purchase
essential commodities and articles which they could not make themselves.
Eventually, as their homesteads were developed they would attain a
higher standard of living than that which they had previously
enjoyed.</p>
<p>Now in determining how much was needed for the initial investment,
the food to be produced—which determined the land area—was the deciding
factor. A typical dietary for a middle-class family of five persons may
be used as a base for this purpose, variations from it increasing or
decreasing the investment. A variation toward a vegetarian diet would
both decrease the land area and the investment in livestock; on the
other hand, a variation toward a heavier meat diet would increase the
investment in these directions. The typical dietused in the studies I
made for the Dayton Homestead Units was as follows:</p>

<p>With the exception of sugar—for which it might be possible to
substitute in its entirety honey, maple sugar, and molasses—all of this
food was to be produced on the proposed homesteads. Only the food items
such as coffee, tea, spices, etc., would have to be purchased by the
homesteaders. And of course exotic foodstuffs—oranges, pineapples,
oysters, olive oil—would have to be purchased, though life could very
well be maintained on whatever native foods there were which furnished
the same sort of nutritive elements.</p>
<p>The production of 4,750 pounds of various foods, 200 dozen eggs, and
the 1,200 quarts of milk above listed would require from three to five
acres of land. A homestead of this size would make it possible to raise
not only the food for the table, but the feed for the livestock, the
livestock consisting of 25 laying hens and 25 cockerels or capons
(raised from 75 chicks); two grade or pure-blooded Swiss goats with
their four kids each year (two of these kids, the bucks, could be
slaughtered and added to the meat diet, the does being raised and
probably sold), and two hogs raised from pigs purchased each year. The
bees, of which there ought to be three or four hives, would, of course,
feed themselves. A considerable number of variations in this livestock
scheme are possible without materially changing the land area needed to
raise feed. Turkeys, ducks, and other fowls may be added or substituted
for some of the chickens; sheep raised in place of hogs; a cow used
instead of milch goats. The cow would require more land than the goats;
the addition of sheep or an increase in the quantity of hogs would also
increase the area of land needed for grain and pasturage. The area
devoted to the orchard and the kitchen garden would have to be large
enough to supply about 500 quarts of vegetables and fruits to be canned
and preserved for winter, or to be dehydrated if that method of food
preservation is preferred.</p>
<p>On a three-acre homestead, about one and a half acres of the land
would need to be put in grain for the goats, hogs, and chickens; about a
quarter of an acre into alfalfa, soy beans or some similar crop, and a
half acre reserved for pasturage. A quarter of an acre would be needed
for the corn or wheat for the family’s cereals. This means about two
acres for field crops. The remaining acre would be all that was needed
for the vegetable garden, the orchard, the barnyard, the flower-gardens
and lawns, and the home-site itself. Indeed, if the family were content
to live exclusively on vegetables and nuts, all its food could be raised
on this one acre of land. On this general plan, three acres would be all
that would be needed, while five acres would be a generous allowance. If
a common pasture were made available, the three acres would be ample. I
therefore suggested that the Dayton Homestead Units should consist of
160-acre tracts laid out for between thirty and thirty-five homesteads
of three acres each, with the remainder of the land for common use.</p>
<p>Upon the basis of the land area and food program above outlined, the
investment needed to establish a homestead was calculated as
follows:</p>

<p>To this investment there was added about $120 for groceries and feed
for use during the first six months after movement to the land. Assuming
that the homesteading started in the winter or spring, within six months
production would develop to a point so that no further outside purchases
would have to be made for this purpose. The total investment would
therefore be around $1,000 per family. But not more than $350 to $400 of
this would have to be in cash.</p>
<p>Farms of about 160 acres were to be laid out for the homesteads, and
were to be known as Homestead Units to distinguish them from the
Production Units already established by the unemployed in the city
itself. In the Homestead Units the group activities and cooperative
manufacturing carried on by the Production Units in the city might be
continued to whatever extent the individuals in each group desired. The
whole tract of land would be owned by the unit; title to the individual
homesteads would be based upon perpetual leases, thus preventing
speculation in land. If the farm buildings already on the tract were not
suitable for use as community buildings, they would be gradually altered
for this purpose. The pasture, wood lot, and community buildings would
be owned by the unit as a whole and used by the individual homesteaders
under rules and regulations established by the group. Tractors or
horses, trucks, and heavy agricultural implements might also be
cooperatively owned. Grain farming might be carried on by some units
cooperatively, just as the city units produced clothes, bread, and other
goods cooperatively. As much or as little communal life as the group
desired was thus provided for, the balance between collectivism and
individualism swinging in whatever direction experience and inclination
pointed. Each family was expected, however, to build its own home,
poultry-house, cow-shed, and workshop; to cultivate its own garden, and
set out its own orchard and berry patch, and become in this new and
modernized setting almost as self-sufficient and independent as were the
pioneers of the country a hundred years ago. Trades and crafts were
expected to develop and selling and bartering of produce of which
individual homesteads had a surplus, but no such emphasis was to be
placed upon this as to force a trend toward large-scale production.</p>
<p>The plans looked toward the building of permanent and beautiful
homes. Construction was to follow lines developed by Ernest Flagg for
the building of beautiful and inexpensive small homes. The high cost and
wastes involved in building cellars was therefore to be avoided. While
building the first wing of their homes, the homesteaders were to commute
between Dayton and their new homes, though some of them might camp out,
more or less, if the farm buildings on the site made it practicable to
do so. As soon as they were on the site, they were to begin to garden,
to build their own furniture in their own workshops, to weave cloth on
their own looms, and to make their own clothes on their own
sewing-machines. Electricity was to be brought in for both light and
power, and domestic machinery and appliances used to reduce drudgery to
a minimum. The crushing burdens of elaborate water and sewage systems
were to be avoided by the use of individual automatic pumps and
individual septic tanks.</p>
<p>Dayton, which is this year establishing its first homestead units, is
demonstrating what can be done with very little cash even by unemployed
families. But that an individual family can establish itself on a
homestead with an even smaller cash investment than provided for in the
Dayton plan was demonstrated to my satisfaction by a case with which I
happen to be personally familiar. This family consisted of a man, wife,
and boy eight years old. The man had made an indifferent living for many
years as a chauffeur in and around New York, and when out of work came
to live with his parents, who had a small country home in our section.
One day he came to me with a project for building a road stand on a plot
of land belonging to me. He had, however, no capital with which to buy
the land and barely enough money to equip a stand. He asked for a lease
on the lot, with the privilege of buying it if he managed to make a
success of his stand. I gave him the lease for which he asked, and this
is what happened:</p>
<p>He went to a local lumber-yard and secured a large quantity of
building material on credit. With this he first built a small stand, and
equipped it to sell ice-cream, drinks, and the usual line of roadside
refreshments. While his wife took care of the stand, he built a
four-room house on the back of the lot, though the interior was
unfinished at the time he came to me and told me that the lumber-yard
was pressing him for money. I discovered that he had gone ahead and
built the house, expecting that the stand would earn enough not only to
enable him to buy the lot but to pay for the materials he used in
building. To straighten out the tangle into which his over-optimism had
led him, I arranged a mortgage for him with the building and loan
association from the proceeds of which he paid for his lot, paid for the
building materials for which he was already in debt, and then purchased
enough materials with which to finish his home. His road stand folded up
and disappeared the next winter—it never did make very much money. But
in spite of this disappointment, he managed to earn enough during the
periods when he worked to meet his loan payments, to keep adding to his
homestead, until he finally had a substantial house, a garden and
chicken-yard, and found himself living at a level of comfort and
security which he had never before enjoyed.</p>
<p>Now if a family with virtually no capital and having to rely mainly
on the earnings of occasional periods of work as a chauffeur, can
establish itself in a country home, it ought to be possible for families
with some capital and more earning power to do so. What such a family
need—in addition to courage—according to our experience is enough
capital for the down payment on the purchase price of a place and enough
cash to pay for such materials and equipment as cannot be purchased on
credit. For the rest, they must rely upon their incomes. But that a
modest income, especially during the first few years, will enable them
not only to pay for their place but to develop it into a substantial and
comfortable home, is not difficult to demonstrate on the basis of our
own experience.</p>
<p>Assume that we are dealing with the problem of a family having enough
capital for the first payment on a suitable place, enough cash with
which to equip itself at least as well as we were able to, and with an
income of $2,500 a year—approximately the income with which we worked
our first year. Such a family living in the city would spend its income
about as follows:</p>

<p>Assuming that production upon the homestead increases gradually, and
does not go as far toward self-sufficiency as is planned for the Dayton
experiment, the family budget after moving to the country would look
something like this:</p>

<p>With the family producing its own shelter, instead of renting it,
there is a saving of $500 a year between what would be spent for taxes
and upkeep on their own home and that paid out in rent in the city. In
the case of food, a cut of 50% is possible the moment the garden, the
orchard, and the chicken-yard contribute to the family larder. Between
the sewing-room, the workshop, and the laundry, substantial savings are
possible on clothing and other expenses. A fund of about $1,250 is
therefore made available for investment in the homestead and its
equipment, provided the family does all of its own work. To whatever
extent servants are employed, this fund is reduced. In our own case, we
much preferred to spend a part of it for help and to make our investment
at a slower rate than to try to put so much into “saving” and take so
much out of ourselves.</p>
<p>Surely I have said enough about the problems involved to make it
clear why it is so difficult to answer the questions which are asked us
about how much capital is needed for establishing a homestead in the
country. Whenever I am asked the question I always think of that old
poser, Which is the most important leg of a three-legged stool? The
amount of capital needed is just one part of an equation in three terms,
of which the other two are the income upon which the family can rely,
and the degree to which the family is willing to endure pioneering.</p>

<h1>Security versus Insecurity</h1>
<p>More than a decade has passed since the Borsodi family took flight
from the city. Experimentation, and interpretation of the experiments,
on the Borsodi homestead finally reached a point where what had been
learned had to be given utterance. The result was that protesting essay
which I called <em>This Ugly Civilization</em>. It was an effort to
interpret our quest of comfort and to develop from it a program which
might lead to the conquest of comfort for individuals and families, if
not for society as a whole. But it appeared in 1929, when the country
was most deliriously celebrating the great boom of which Henry Ford was
the prophet and mass production the gospel. Virtually no one wanted to
be told that the whole industrialized world was mistaken; that there was
another way and a better way of making a living and of providing
ourselves with our hearts’ desires than through organized, integrated,
centralized labor. The way which I urged as desirable for the individual
and essential to the salvation of society seemed romantic to some who
read my book; practicable only for exceptional families to other
readers, and hostile to the social centralization for which others were
working.</p>
<p>The situation is different today.</p>
<p>As I write these lines, the newspapers are carrying a story to the
effect that 15,252,000 men and women are unemployed. This means,
according to <em>The Business Week</em>, which was responsible for this
estimate, that during November, 1932, over 31.2% of those who are
normally employed in the United States were unable to earn a living: 46%
of those ordinarily employed in manufacturing; 45% of those in mining;
40% of those in forestry and fishing; 38% of those in transportation;
35% of those in domestic and personal service; 21% of those in trade;
17% of those in agriculture; 10% of those in public service; and 10% of
our professional classes were unemployed. On the basis of one and a half
dependents for each worker, 37,500,000 men, women, and children were
directly affected by unemployment. And the situation since that estimate
was made has become steadily worse. But these millions by no means
number fully all those affected by the economic catastrophe which struck
the country four years ago. It would be safe to say that again as many
have had their standards of living sharply reduced by reductions in
wages, by part-time work, and by declines in the price of what they
produce or possess. And if we were to add those who live in terror of
unemployment or of financial ruin, almost every person in the country
would have to be included.</p>
<p>After nearly two centuries of industrial expansion and a full century
of social reforms during which we destroyed monarchical tyranny,
abolished human slavery, established a sound currency, reduced greatly
the hours of labor, granted universal suffrage, and adopted countless
other reforms, we find most of the country unemployed, reduced to
poverty, dependent upon charity, in terror of ruin! In spite of the fact
that the whole history of industrial expansion and social reform is
filled with demonstrations of the impossibility of establishing
security, much less happiness, by any measures which still leave the
individual dependent for his living upon the industrial behemoth, what
has thus far been done and what is now proposed by industrial leaders,
politicians, and economists is in the main merely a continuance of the
futile process of trying to produce prosperity by creating new
industries, expanding credit, cheapening money, spreading work,
shortening hours of labor, or establishing unemployment insurance.</p>
<p>Yesterday a young married man I know lost his position. The
manufacturing company for which he had been working for four years as a
salesman had to let him go. There had been nothing wrong with his work;
the volume of the company’s business had simply declined to a point
which made it imperative that they lay off another man, and as the
youngest salesman on the staff, he was the one to be dropped.</p>
<p>For months he and his wife had lived in terror of this possibility. A
six-months-old baby, with the added financial responsibilities involved,
had increased the fear with which they had contemplated the possibility
of unemployment—at a time when millions were unemployed. Now the blow
had fallen. With only three weeks’ pay in his pocket, he and his wife,
neither of them over twenty-five years of age, were simply
terror-stricken. The landlord, the milkman, the butcher, the
grocer—those upon whom they were immediately dependent for food and
shelter—were suddenly transformed into menaces. Some idea of what this
terror meant to this couple, as in one degree or another it has meant to
millions of others in these troublous times, can be gathered from the
fact that when my wife called the young mother on the phone, shortly
after the husband left for work the morning following his discharge, to
ask her not to remain alone if she was worrying, the hysterical answer
received was that she couldn’t come over just then—that she had suffered
some kind of hysterical spell after her husband left her, had become
nauseated, and vomited, but that after she straightened herself out, she
would come right over.</p>
<p>Then there is the Segerstrom family. This is not their name—but it
suggests their real name. Segerstrom is a carpenter. He has recently
worked for me a little at odd jobs, so that I know him to be a
hard-working, conscientious workman. He has an equally hard-working
wife, and five children. Up to the collapse of the building boom in the
fall of 1929, as far as I can now learn, he worked steadily month after
month, earned high wages, and lived according to the conventional
standard of skilled workingmen of his class. The Segerstroms then lived
in a home which they had bought for a little down and a little each
month; they owned a Ford car; they had the usual kind of furniture in
their home, a radio, and all the comforts to which they felt an American
standard of living entitled them. They had even managed to save a little
money, some of which had been invested in securities recommended to them
by the bank in which they deposited their money.</p>
<p>Then came the crash. Regular employment ended. At the end of the
fourth winter of occasional work at odd jobs they had lost their home,
lost and sold virtually all their furniture, and when we first heard of
them they were living in a rented house in the country without a single
modern convenience, and dependent upon the wood which they could cut in
the woods about their house for fuel with which to keep warm during the
wintry weather in this climate. His wife was working as a maid three
days a week, and this managed to bring in just enough cash with which to
pay the rent and occasionally buy some groceries. For the rest, they
were engaged in a desperate struggle to get enough odd jobs and
occasionally a little work at his trade of carpenter to keep the family
from descending to the charitable agencies for relief.</p>
<p>As I write, Mrs. Segerstrom has lost her job as a maid, the family
which had employed her having decided to move to another part of
suburban New York. As far as I can judge, through no fault of their own
but merely because of their blind reliance and dependence upon the
scheme of living which is conventional in our industrial civilization,
this family is going to become an object of public charity. In that
respect their problem is the problem of millions of equally sober,
decent, and useful human beings today.</p>
<p>Or take the case of the Smythes, which also is not their name, but
suggests the two of them.</p>
<p>The Smythes were a rather proud couple in their fifties. They had no
children. They had a nice home of their own in one of the most
fashionable sections of northern Jersey. They drove a Chrysler,
purchased when that meant more than it does today. Their home was much
more than comfortably furnished. Smythe had been cashier and
confidential man in some kind of brokerage business for over twenty
years. His firm decided to liquidate, owing to the losses sustained when
commodity prices slumped early in the depression. Through no fault of
his own, Smythe found himself at fifty trying to secure any sort of
position at all in which his knowledge of bookkeeping might be used. But
not only was there an oversupply of bookkeepers—there was no demand at
all for bookkeepers of his age. In spite of his efforts to locate
himself for a period of nearly two years, the time finally came when the
Smythes were reduced to a state in which they were without coal with
which to heat their house, their telephone was being disconnected, and
they had virtually nothing left to set upon the table. But so far as the
neighbors could see, nothing was wrong. The Smythes seemed to be living
substantially as they had been living for the past two years.</p>
<p>But one day the neighbors became conscious of the fact that the
Smythes had disappeared. Investigation showed that two days before
Smythe had picked up a hatchet, split open his wife’s skull as she lay
in bed, gone down to his garage, started the motor in his car, lain down
by the exhaust, and asphyxiated himself.</p>
<p>Then there was the case of Jones—which promises to end more hopefully
than that of Smythe.</p>
<p>One day I received a letter from a man named Jones, or a name very
similar to Jones, begging the privilege of an interview. He had read
<em>This Ugly Civilization</em>, he wrote, and had a straightforward
question he wanted to put to me. He asked me to give him a few minutes
in which to put his case before me if I possibly could spare the time,
since he was prepared to stake all he had upon my answer to it. Of
course I saw him. And this is the story he told me.</p>
<p>“Mr. Borsodi,” he said, “I am an accountant. The firm for which I
used to work failed just about a year ago. I had worked for them for
nine years. But I had made such a good record and had managed to save
$1,500, so that I wasn’t particularly worried. But that was a year ago.
Since that time I have walked the streets of New York without a single,
real chance to secure any kind of a position which would enable me to
support my wife and daughter. I have tried almost everything. I have
answered every help-wanted advertisement in the newspapers, registered
with all sorts of employment agencies, called on all my friends and
relatives and almost everybody with whom I was even remotely acquainted,
in an effort to find some sort of work which I might do. Fortunately, my
wife was able to secure occasional employment in a department store,
clerking at the counter. She would leave our little girl with her
grandmother during the period she worked. But in spite of the money she
managed to earn, and a little which I managed to pick up, we have been
steadily wiping out our savings. Even after practicing every sort of
economy, the rent makes big holes in our savings each month, though we
have managed to even reduce this by doubling up with my wife’s parents.
Today I have only $500 left of my original savings. And I can see the
end of that this coming year.</p>
<p>“Like lots of other men, when tired of walking around, I have dropped
into the public libraries to read and get my mind off my troubles. About
a week ago I happened to pick up your book, <em>This Ugly
Civilization</em>, and I raced through it—it seemed to be written just
for me. I don’t need to tell you how it affected me. It seemed to
furnish the complete answer to just such problems as the one with which
I had been struggling. But what a ghastly joke that I should have
stumbled upon your book only after most of my capital had been sunk in
the sheer cost of keeping my family alive this past year. I have been
torturing myself ever since thinking about what I might have done to
maintain them if I had worked in a garden of my own instead of just
tramping the streets of New York trying to find jobs under conditions
such as prevail at present!</p>
<p>“Now, Mr. Borsodi, the question I would like to ask you is this:
Should I take a chance with my last $500 and try to get to the country,
where we would have a chance at least to partially support ourselves,
even if we couldn’t do it completely right away, or should I take a
chance on finding work before my $500 has all gone to the milkman, the
grocer, and the landlord? Is it possible, with only $500 cash, to make a
start toward the independence of a job which you advocate in your book?
This is the question which my wife and I have been debating night after
night ever since I read your book. What do you think? I am perfectly
willing to work. I think I can make a success of such a homestead as you
describe; my wife is willing to work just as hard as I am—but will $500
enable us to make a start toward independence?”</p>
<p>The terror, the suffering, and the tragedies of my young neighbor, of
the Segerstrom family, of the Smythes, of Jones the accountant, and of
most of the millions of men and women who are unemployed today, are
consequences of that mysterious phenomenon known as the business
cycle—mysterious as to cause but not as to effects—which periodically
produces in our industrial civilization a decline in the volume of
trade, a sharp drop in prices, a shrinkage in the amount of credit, a
decrease in the demand for goods, a decline in the volume of production,
and in consequence an increase in the number of unemployed. Men and
women at work in factories and offices and stores, workers in building
and in railroading, all the myriads engaged in the services, trades, and
professions—barbers, waiters, actors, artists, reporters, architects,
who are busily at work during periods of prosperity and good
times—suddenly find themselves out of work, while those who remained
employed find themselves in most cases working only a part of each week
and at lower wages and salaries. A force beyond their control and in
most cases utterly beyond their comprehension suddenly leaves them
without the income with which to pay rent, buy food, purchase clothing,
and pay their debts.</p>
<p>But equally through no fault of their own, other millions of cogs in
our industrialized world and inter-dependent economic system find
themselves periodically without the income which will enable them to buy
the necessaries of life because of seasonal unemployment, or
technological unemployment, or what I call style unemployment. Just as
the winter season tends to throw building-workers out of employment, and
the invention of new machines and new techniques tends to throw out of
employment those engaged in manufacturing staple and established
products, so style changes with their shifts in demand from wool dress
goods to silk, from short skirts to long skirts, from crockery to
glassware, and from phonographs to radios, create unemployment for
workers in some industries even though employment is created for other
workers in other industries.</p>
<p>And quite without regard to whether the cause is seasonal, or
cyclical, or technological, or style unemployment, all these victims of
unemployment are alike in this respect, that they are periodically
unable to support themselves and their families through no fault of
their own because of <em>their dependence upon what they earn as a cog
in some part of the complex machinery of our factory-dominated
civilization</em>. If the period of unemployment proves to be a short
one, their savings are reduced or wiped out and debts accumulated which
impair their ability to save for some time after they are again
employed, while if the period proves a long one—as long as the period
through which twelve or thirteen millions of Americans are now
struggling—they are apt to become social charges, to become utterly
demoralized by public charity, and in the end not only to loathe but to
become revolters against a social system which subjects them to such
treatment.</p>
<p>The popular formula of social reformers for mitigating the evils of
unemployment is unemployment insurance—which deals with the effect of
the trouble, and the popular formula for ending unemployment
altogether—is to have the government in some way or other control if not
own and operate all industry.</p>
<p>Neither the formula for mitigation which merely shifts the cost of
unemployment from those unemployed to those employed, nor the formula
for ending unemployment—which merely shifts the control of our economic
life from capitalists to public officials of some sort or other—appeals
particularly to me. Neither furnishes, in my opinion, a cure for the
fundamental defect in our present economic system—the excessive
dependence of individual men and women for their livelihoods upon the
smooth functioning of nation-wide and even international economic
activities.</p>
<p>There remains to be considered the formula of despair—that the
unemployed should leave our cities and turn to farming to support their
families. But the modern farmer, specializing in the production for sale
of wheat or cotton or milk, has just as difficult a problem in employing
himself profitably as has the wage-worker or the office-worker. For the
unemployed to exchange their present dependence upon industrial activity
for dependence upon agricultural prices—for them to exchange the
insecurities of the labor market for the insecurities of the grain or
cattle or produce markets—is merely to jump out of the frying-pan into
the fire.</p>
<p>The only reason that everybody does not as yet recognize the fact
that the average farmer has a problem of employment is because the evil
effects of a decline in the price of the crop he produces do not put him
on charity as quickly as the evil effects of a decline in the sales of
the products of some industry. With declines in sales of manufactured
products, industrial workers are promptly laid off or fired, but with
declines in agricultural prices, unemployment only appears after
foreclosure of farms for non-payment of interest and taxes leaves
farmers without farms on which to work. It is true, of course, that the
evil effects of dependence upon the general condition of business are
smaller in degree in the case of farmers, even for those who specialize
in cash crops such as wheat and cotton and hogs, because most farmers
tend to produce some of their own necessities of life. If they own their
own farms, they at least provide their own shelter instead of renting
it. If they have a vegetable-garden and orchard, or a cow and some
chickens, they at least produce some of their own foodstuffs. Even
though they are in the long run affected disastrously by their
dependence upon the growing of crops sold in the produce markets at
prices fixed by the total supply and demand for what they produce, this
limited degree of production for use gives to farmers in general a
position somewhat more secure than that of industrial workers. But that
is all. The more dependent the farmer is upon his cash crop, the more he
is apt to suffer from the problem of employment.</p>
<p>The essence of the matter is that when the farmer shifted his
productive activities from production for his own use to production for
sale, he subjected himself to economic insecurities of a type roughly
comparable in nature to the insecurities to which the wage-worker and
the office-worker are now subjected. The farmer at one time was
self-sufficient. He not only produced his own foodstuffs; he produced
his own fabrics and clothing. Weaving and knitting were as much the
activities of the homestead as farming. Sheep furnished him wool; the
cattle he slaughtered furnished him leather; a wood lot furnished him
fuel for heat and cooking. The farmer of the past, in most instances,
spent the part of the year when farming operations could not be
performed because of the season, operating grist-mills or lumber-mills,
or working at some craft or trade. Such a life had only the insecurities
which nature itself seems to impose upon human activities, and the
possible damage from storm and drought, from locusts and hail, was
reduced by storage of supplies and diversification of production. The
threat of dispossession and unemployment which the dependence of the
farmer upon the cash market has brought into farming was then unknown.
Today farmers have abandoned not only the production of fabrics and
clothing, but on about 20% of the farms in this country there is not
even a cow or a chicken; on 30% there is not a single hog, and on
approximately 90% not even one sheep. What is more, on many of the farms
in our banner agricultural states no gardens are kept and almost every
article of food is purchased at the store. If the unemployed of the
cities turn to that kind of farming, they will merely have exchanged one
kind of economic insecurity for another.</p>
<p>What is called subsistence farming, however, is a step, though only a
step, in the right direction.</p>
<p>But no return to farming, no establishment of unemployment insurance,
and not even the planning or socialization of industrial activities,
will furnish an adequate alternative way of life to the artist and
craftsman for whom the problem of living includes some sort of escape
from the repetitive work which is all that an industrial civilization
offers them.</p>
<p>A short time ago I received the following letter from a man with
quite a reputation as a poet. The situation with which he has been
confronted by our industrial civilization is quite typical of that with
which countless numbers of talented men and women are today faced. Since
my book appeared I have received scores of similar letters:</p>
<blockquote>
<p> The question that persisted in my mind after reading the necessarily
incomplete account of your ideas and their operation in that interview,
is this: Can your plans, obviously sound and salutary in their
application to a crisis like the present, be made continuously
operative; not only, that is, to provide self-sustaining work instead of
wasteful charity to the jobless victims of hard times, but to afford a
continuous way of living through all kinds of times? But by “way of
living” I do not mean an existence just beyond the margin of want, nor a
way devoid of participation in the characteristic conveniences of modern
times; I do not mean a mere throw-back to the simplicity that
characterized American farm and rural-town life up to fifty or sixty
years ago; but I mean, can a community organized on your principles not
only afford a sane, healthful existence to its members, but also, as
long as a capitalistic organization of society endures, a modest and
constant increment of usable wealth in the form of money, to give access
to the world and its goods outside the community, to provide insurance
against age and casualty, and to provide some inheritance for the next
generation?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Consider my own position. Born and raised in a city, reared and
educated not to use my hands but to use my head to “get along” in life;
overlooked by nature, however, in the distribution of the acquisitive
instinct; I have drifted and tumbled along through life, never producing
anything (except some negligible literature and criticism), but
precariously holding and losing various parasitical jobs, seldom quite
earning my way. Finally comes a small inheritance, some of which was
lost in Wall Street; the bulk of it, small enough, is in the soundest
investments the country affords; which nowadays yield diminished income,
have in part lost their liquidity, and are slowly melting as I draw on
them to eke out earnings, by myself and my wife, insufficient to meet
the expenses of a modest scale of living. I can in the nature of things
have no program but to live carefully and keep alert for another chance
at parasitical employment, in government or in private business.</p>
<p>Is there a saner way, not as a temporary expedient, but as a
permanent program?</p>
<p>–and a way which would enable us not only to keep housed, clothed,
and fed, but to have some freedom of movement, some chance to
participate in the good things which our urbanized, industrialized,
capitalistic civilization does afford, along with its evils?</p>
<p>That there is such a program is shown by the letters which follow,
one from a letter received shortly after <em>This Ugly Civilization</em>
was published and the other, from a letter received from the same writer
two and a half years later:</p>
<blockquote>
<p> I have just finished reading <em>This Ugly Civilization</em>, and
cannot rest until I have made an effort to let you know what it means to
me. Though I attained the age of thirty only a few days ago, I have long
been preaching many of the reforms you advocate. And as librarian and
instructor in an institution filled with herd-minded students and
instructors, controlled by quantity-minded capitalists and politicians,
and located in a hopelessly conventional and very religious college
community, you may be able to imagine the inhibitions and morbid mental
confinement of my existence. Having the sweet companionship of your book
in such an iron-clad environment of bondage is comparable to the Mormon
conception of Joseph Smith finding the golden tablets.</p>
<p>As librarian I am ever searching the publications which list and
advertise new books and when I first saw yours advertised, I began to
hope that my long search, with its many disappointments, had at last
found its reward. In reading page after page I rejoiced to find not only
my own ideas, but a great many more which I had not yet arrived at, all
expressed in clear, logical language. You see, for years I have been
slowly yet carefully gathering notes… building up my case against the
masses who control my every action… gradually preparing myself for the
time when I might stand high on my firm and ever-accumulating foundation
of fact and reason and denounce them all. Somehow I can’t get over the
feeling that the book was prepared especially for me, that I might grasp
it eagerly: a complete and carefully constructed basis upon which to
rest my own peculiar philosophy of life.</p>
<p>My most cherished dream has long been the establishment of my own
“little island of intelligence and beauty” that should stand gallantly
and undefiled “amidst the chaotic seas of human stupidity and ugliness.”
Nearly a year ago I selected and purchased ten acres of land and will
soon be able to make the final payment on it. We have managed to erect a
habitable building, dig and equip a well, and raise a small flock of
pullets; and my dear old mother is heroically holding the fort until we
can achieve the financial status necessary for me to join her. And if
nothing happens this should be within the present year. Then, with my
mother, the two children of my deceased brother, and a distant young
lady who has promised to share the trans-valuation with me, I plan to
sacrifice the present emoluments and future prospects of my profession
and begin the great experiment of my life.</p>
<p>Your book comes at an opportune time to serve as my handbook of
procedure and inspiration. And, having the encouragement it has brought
and my plans for the reasonable life so far along, I feel sufficiently
independent to begin to voice more openly the ideas which I have so long
considered in secret. Hereafter I shall not only speak on the subject,
but I intend to quote appropriate passages from your book. Of course I
shall place one or more copies of it on the library shelves. However,
there is every reason to believe that, if it reaches the hands of any of
the more conservative members of the faculty (and it probably will),
they will request its removal because of the remarks on religion.</p>
<p>But why worry over trifles?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>About two and a half years later and over a year after the writer of
this letter had moved to his own “island of intelligence and beauty,” I
received, the following letter from him:</p>
<blockquote>
<p> Since receiving your letter some two years ago, I have had ample
time to consider the truth of your statement that the cards were stacked
against the farmer. However, we may console ourselves with the fact that
the farmer is not now suffering alone. Here I did not plan to farm on a
large scale, but only to have some chickens. With the chickens I have
used plenty of caution and as yet have not suffered any losses. Despite
the depression, things have gone on quite well. I have a position at the
local university library and divide my time between this seat of
learning and the ranch. We have a comfortable home, ten acres and the
first three units of the chicken arrangement finished and it is all paid
for so we feel fairly independent.</p>
<p>We are all well satisfied and like the open spaces more all the time.
In some respects our situation is ideal. Although it takes less than
fifteen minutes to reach the city, we are far enough out to hear the
coyotes howl now and then. We enjoy (more than I had thought possible)
the attractions of the city along with the peace and freedom of the
desert. I think this type of community will be more and more popular in
the future. As yet no house is closer than a quarter of a mile to us,
yet we have all the essential conveniences of the city such as
electricity for light, power, and heating; telephone, daily newspaper
service, all kinds of city delivery such as ice, coal, milk, laundry,
and the like.</p>
<p>But what I like most is the diversified work that I have to do out
here; it is such a delightful variety in contrast to the routine work I
have been used to. Out here no day seems half long enough, for there is
everything from writing poetry to cleaning the hen-house to be done, and
every type of activity is interesting.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Need anything more be said on this subject?</p>
<p>For this man, and for any man who will similarly start on the road to
independence, the problem of employment can hardly be said to exist.</p>
</section>
<section id="independence-versus-dependence" class="level1">
<h1>Independence versus Dependence</h1>
<p>It is a simple dictate of the heart which says: If a man is hungry,
feed him; if he is naked, clothe him; if he is homeless, shelter
him.</p>
<p>But it is a dictate neither of the heart nor of the head, which says,
if a man is unemployed, support him.</p>
<p>Yet in one way or another, most of what is being done to relieve the
distress and suffering of the millions who are unemployed as a result of
the depression amounts to nothing more than that those who are employed
shall support those who are not. Most relief, and most plans for relief,
are merely measures for supporting (or tiding over) the unemployed for
that indefinite period of time which they will have to spend looking for
work or waiting for work to turn up. That home relief, and food tickets,
and bread lines, are measures for supporting the unemployed is obvious.
It is not so obvious—but it is nevertheless the same thing—to “make
work” for them; that is, to invent such work as cleaning the parks of a
city as a mere excuse for doling out cash to them. And it is still the
same thing—supporting the unemployed—to make those who are employed
“share” their work with them so that both shall be partly employed and
partly unemployed. And many of the remedies for unemployment, such as
unemployment insurance, however ingeniously they may be dressed up, are
still merely measures for supporting the unemployed. For unemployment
insurance is merely a device by which contributions from those employed,
from the employers, and from the government are doled out to support
those who are unemployed.</p>
<p>My first point, therefore, is this: I am utterly opposed to all
measures for relief which upon analysis show themselves to be mere
measures for supporting the unemployed. I am opposed to them on three
grounds.</p>
<p>First, because they are evasions of the problem of the unemployed.
They are not solutions of their problem. The public gives for relief,
and the public pays taxes for relief, and the public hopes, just like
Mr. Micawber, that “something will turn up” to end the depression and
that the problem will then vanish.</p>
<p>Secondly, I am opposed to mere support of the unemployed because of
the financial drain which such support inflicts upon their friends and
relatives (to whom they first turn) ; to the financial drain which it
puts upon industry to whatever extent industry and commerce try to
support them; and to the drain upon taxpayers to whatever extent
municipal, and state, and national funds are used to support them.</p>
<p>Finally, I am opposed to them because they are demoralizing to the
unemployed. They break down their self-respect. They destroy their sense
of responsibility and self-reliance; in short, they pauperize them.</p>
<p>There is, however, in my opposition to supporting the unemployed, and
what I said in the beginning about the imperious duty of feeding the
hungry, clothing the naked, and sheltering the homeless, no
contradiction. What we do for the temporary assistance of unfortunate
fellow creatures, particularly when their misfortune is not of their own
contriving, is true charity. I do not like the word charity, though it
is the only one that I can think of in this connection. For this sort of
assistance is really a species of hospitality; when we give this sort of
temporary assistance we are only doing, indirectly, what used to be the
universal custom for us to do for every stranger who knocked at the
doors of the pioneer homesteads of America’s past.</p>
<p>But if we are not to support the unemployed—beyond giving them what I
have spoken of as temporary assistance—what then are we to do for them
at this time?</p>
<p>I have an answer for this question. And unlike most of the answers to
it, it is so completely the obvious answer that I dare not state it
until some sort of background for it has been prepared. For my answer
cannot be fully appreciated, it cannot be fully understood, its complete
practicality cannot be realized, until we have first thought through
completely what the problem of unemployment really is.</p>
<p>We have in this country at present about fifteen million men and
women, formerly employed, who are today unemployed. In the aggregate,
this army of ex-factory-workers, ex-farm-laborers, ex-railroad-workers,
ex-office and store workers, has created such a stupendous and complex
problem that it is easy for us to forget that in its fundamentals the
problem of every one of these fifteen million human beings is exactly
the same. If we consider it from the standpoint of the individual
unemployed workers, we shall avoid the danger of being deceived by the
sheer size of the problem. Now if we consider it this way, here is what
we find: John Doe, who was formerly employed—perhaps in an office,
perhaps in a factory—is now no longer employed by that office or that
factory. What is more, he cannot find employment in other offices or
factories.</p>
<p>What, now, is the difference in John Doe’s situation before
unemployment and after? Before unemployment and while he was still
employed, he received every pay day a certain sum of money as wages or
salary for the time he spent working for the firm which employed him.
John Doe, if he was the breadwinner of a family, took this money and
with it his family bought food and clothes and entertainment; they paid
for housing in the form of rent (or if they owned their own home, in the
form of taxes or interest), and they paid the installments on debts
which they had contracted in buying their furniture, their automobile,
their home, and if they were thrifty, they saved a part of the pay for a
rainy day by depositing it in a savings-bank, paying for insurance, or
in some cases actually investing it in stocks and bonds.</p>
<p>After unemployment, John Doe no longer received any wages or salary.
If the family had been fortunate and thrifty up to that time and had
accumulated something in the way of savings, these savings were drawn
upon to meet current expenses. When the savings were exhausted, they
began to sell their investments, their automobile, their home, their
furniture, in order to get the money with which to maintain the family.
Then they began to borrow from friends and relatives in order to do so;
they bought on credit from the merchants whom they had formerly been
able to pay regularly; finally, when all these means of securing the
things they needed to keep body and soul together were exhausted, they
turned to the charitable and relief agencies. Then these agencies began
to give them the money directly with which to buy them or they gave them
indirectly—by paying it to those stores upon whom John Doe and his
family were given orders for food or by paying it to the landlords who
furnished the shelter for the family.</p>
<p>In the meantime, what had John Doe been doing? He was doing what he
was expected to do—spending his time looking for employment; going from
one factory to another, from one employment agency to the next,
answering one help-wanted advertisement after another, and trying to
find odd jobs for which he could get some money to help in the
emergency. And when physically or spiritually too exhausted to spend his
time looking for work, he spent it waiting for business to pick up, so
that he could get back to his old job, whatever it may have been. And in
doing this, and spending his time in this way, he is encouraged by
virtually all the relief agencies established to cope with the
depression up to the present time.</p>
<p>But not only the relief agencies. He is encouraged in the course
outlined by the whole commercial world. All our big industrial and
financial leaders tell him that he has only to wait—that in time a
readjustment will be effected and that then employment will again become
normal. And they tell him to remember that while he is unemployed their
capital is unemployed. While he has to worry about himself and his
family, they have the burden not only of trying to manage their plants
and to employ as many people as possible, but also the worry of
protecting the investors in their business. So he is assured that
everybody is in the same boat; that it is only necessary to avoid
rocking the boat and sooner or later the pilots will get it back safely
into harbor.</p>
<p>And of course the “pilots” or political leaders tell him
substantially the same thing. Great economic forces about which they are
often extremely vague have upset the markets of the world. For the
moment, they are just as powerless in coping with these economic forces
as they used to be powerless in the face of natural forces such as
famines and plagues. While the government and Congress experiments with
one expedient after another in its efforts to create a revival of trade,
a feeling of confidence among business men, and a rise in prices, there
is nothing for John Doe and the millions like him to do but wait until
things pick up again.</p>
<p>But what is even worse, our social reformers in slightly different
words tell him virtually the same thing. There is nothing particularly
wrong, according to them, with the complex industrial system which had
formerly employed him. It is still a marvelous system, far superior to
any which had ever previously been relied upon by mankind for supplying
it with its needs and desires. <em>What is wrong is the control or
ownership of the system</em>. It is the profit system, not the
industrial system, which is responsible for his plight. According to
them, all that is necessary is to establish a plan board—to adopt a
five-year plan of our own—or to have the state take over the ownership
of industry altogether and run it for use and not for profit. In the
meantime, while we are still struggling with the follies of capitalism
and individualism, all that can be done as a sort of stop-gap for the
emergency is to establish government employment agencies, increase the
numbers employed directly or indirectly by the government, and adopt a
system of unemployment insurance.</p>
<p>I disagree with all of them. The unemployed, if they can’t be given
work here and now by our industrial system, should not be asked to live
half hungry, half naked, half cold, while waiting for business to pick
up. Above all they should not be fed upon promises of blissful security
in the distant future after our reformers have finished tinkering with
the industrial system and remolding all our institutions nearest to
their heart’s desire.</p>
<p>When a family cannot support itself, and secure the food, clothing,
and shelter it needs by getting employment in a factory, or an office,
or a store, the only sensible thing for it to do is to support itself by
producing these things for itself on its own homestead. If the
unemployed are to be made secure at least as to the needs of life,
nothing short of this is adequate. They surely cannot be made secure by
shifting their dependence for their livelihood from the business cycle
to the political cycle, neither of which is capable of coping with the
inherent insecurity of industrial production.</p>
<p>Let us not fool ourselves about what the future holds in store for
us. There are at present no grounds whatever for expecting any return to
normal business very soon. No responsible student of business conditions
expects any complete solution of the problem of unemployment during the
coming year. Eventually another period of expansion may come, but as in
the depression of 1873, it may take ten years to get back to full
employment again.</p>
<p>These facts are so generally recognized that everywhere plans are
being made for the continuation of direct relief programs. In New York
City, where the situation is in many ways typical of that in all our
industrial cities, there are over 200,000 unemployed families. Without
including the uncounted number of destitute single men and women, this
means that over 1,000,000 human beings are now dependent upon relief and
charity for their food, clothing, and shelter. With no prospects of
business improvement, plans are being made to support this number of
families for the whole of 1933. It is true that from time to time some
of these families secure work and so become self-supporting, but others
are laid off to take their place. The same issue of the <em>New York
Times</em> which carried a story about a slight improvement in business
in the fall of 1932, carried another story about the laying off of 2,800
men by a single corporation in New York City.</p>
<p>At the request of the Emergency Home Relief Bureau, the New York City
Welfare Agencies prepared a budget covering the merest necessities for
these families. On the basis of that budget, the taxpayers, the
contributors to relief funds, and the relatives of the unemployed, are
faced with the appalling problem of raising $161,370,000 for the support
of these families for the single year of 1933.</p>
<p>Now what does this sort of relief mean to the individual family?</p>
<p>While the breadwinners of the family are supposed to be out looking
for work, each family of five is to receive a bare subsistence ration of
$6.85 in food each week; a minimum clothing budget of $2.45 per week; a
fuel and light budget of $2.9 5 per week; a minimum rent budget of $4.50
per week. This is a total for each family, each week of $15.85, without
provision for accident and illness, birth and death. In the course of
one year, even on this minimum basis, $824.20 will have to be expended
on each unemployed family consisting of five persons.</p>
<p>Eight hundred dollars, at the present purchasing power of the dollar,
is a lot of money. Yet I know, upon the basis of my own experience, that
it is more than is required as the initial capital with which to
establish a self-sufficient homestead.</p>
<p>It is much more than the amount with which many of our pioneer
forefathers established themselves in the country and supported
themselves indefinitely.</p>
<p>If even half that sum—not more than five hundred dollars—were to be
intelligently laid out for land and lumber, for seeds, livestock, and
implements, the average family could produce for itself the bare
essentials of living, and have plenty of time left for part-time or
seasonal employment in industry. With proper instruction and leadership,
not much more than half the sum which is now being spent to support a
family for a year would be sufficient to take one family permanently off
the relief list. It would do more. It would not only enable them to
support themselves; it would ultimately make it possible for them to
repay the money and materials furnished them.</p>
<p>The problem of unemployment would for them have been solved. The
drain upon the community for their support would have been ended, the
self-respect of the unemployed restored.</p>
<p>We have raised hundreds of millions already for unemployment relief.
Since we have used it merely to support the unemployed, we now find
ourselves face to face with the necessity of doing the same thing over
and over again. Instead of spending more and more millions to support
the unemployed while the depression is dragging its weary way over the
years, why shouldn’t we use the public’s “will-to-give” to enable the
unemployed to support themselves? Why shouldn’t we furnish them land,
tools, lumber, seed, livestock, wool, leather, raw materials of all
kinds to enable them to establish themselves once again in the
homesteads which they should never have abandoned as many of them did
perhaps generations back? Above all, while doing so, let us use our
universities and our social agencies for the purpose of guiding and
instructing those of them who may have forgotten, or never learned, how
to wrest the necessities of life directly from their own land and their
own efforts.</p>
<p>We should not only relieve them temporarily.</p>
<p>If we did it on a sufficiently large scale, we would end the problem
of unemployment for the whole country, and end it permanently.</p>
<p>For a hundred years America has been developing its factory
system.</p>
<p>Year after year we have been building up our cities; steadily we have
been shifting our population from the country (where they used to at one
time support themselves) into cities (where they became wholly dependent
upon industry for their livelihood). And while doing this, we have
boasted about the glorious conquests of the machine age. The machine age
was shortening the hours of labor; it was annihilating space and
enabling us to fly; it was furnishing even the humblest of us magical
amusements–“pictures” which moved and talked, and “radios” which brought
song and speech on the waves of the air.</p>
<p>Yet today, millions of the beneficiaries of this machine age are no
longer worrying about maintaining the high standard of living about
which we have been boasting. They have lost their aspirations for
two-car garages, and new models each year. They are no longer trying to
keep up with the Joneses.</p>
<p>We have dotted the landscape with our factories. We have filled the
cities with skyscrapers. We have covered the continent with a network of
rails and roadways. But in spite of all these things, we have been
unable to furnish the American people security even as to such bare
essentials as food and clothing and shelter.</p>
<p>During the depression of 1837 they were told that the Central Bank of
the United States was responsible for the country’s depression. So they
abolished it.</p>
<p>During the depression of 1854 they were told that the state banks and
their wild-cat currency were responsible for the country’s depression.
So they established national banks and a national currency.</p>
<p>During the depression of 1907, they were told that the lack of a
central banking system was responsible for the country’s depressions. So
they established the Federal Reserve system.</p>
<p>Today they are being told that the lack of balance between production
and consumption is responsible for the country’s depression, and that
economic planning will end the country’s depressions.</p>
<p>During the last few years they have read endlessly in books and
magazines and newspapers about the wonders of the Russian five-year
plan. They have been told that planning was not only the way out of the
depression, but also the way to security and a better way of life.</p>
<p>Once again they are pricking up their hopes. Once again they are
asking themselves whether at last the doctors haven’t found the one
thing which will tame the machine age and furnish the country the
security it has long been denied. But suppose they establish a plan
board for industry. Suppose America adopts a five-year plan of her own.
Suppose it tries out economic planning. It has tried nearly everything
else. I have no doubt that it will try planning, too.</p>
<p>And then it shall be once again disappointed.</p>
<p>After all, the planning board will have to be composed of human
beings, and human beings are all too human. They make mistakes. Even if
the members of the Supreme Economic Council, or whatever the planning
board would be called, prove all to be chaste, incorruptible, and
without ambition (which I refuse to believe a reasonable expectation),
there is no guarantee that even the most virtuous board will not make
mistakes.</p>
<p>The Russians, in spite of their revolutionary zeal, have made them.
Their five-year plan called for the socialization of agriculture.
Farming was to be mechanized. Farming was to be collectivized. The
little, inefficient farms of the peasants were to be merged into giant,
efficient farms run by machinery, and transformed into wheat
factories.</p>
<p>Within a year and a half from the time they started to carry out
their plan, the Russians socialized more of these farms than they
expected to take over in five years. The plan was hailed as a tremendous
success, not only by the Russians, but by the advocates of planning
everywhere in the world. But, unfortunately, something went wrong. The
planners miscalculated. With that sublime indifference to the human
equation which they borrowed from engineering, the Gosplan overlooked
how the peasants would react to this appropriation of what had been
their personal property. During the process of converting the little
farms into giant farms, millions of horses and cows and pigs and
chickens were slaughtered by the peasants who couldn’t see eye to eye
with the agents of the Soviet. Within a short time, not only was there a
shortage of meat for the table, there were no horses for plowing and
cultivating and harvesting. The effect upon food production was
cumulatively bad. Today, in spite of their five-year plan, in spite of
their pathetic faith in the efficacy of socialism, the whole of Russia
is on a starvation diet. True, some sections of the population—the
proletariat—are specially favored. But then so are certain sections of
the population with us, only we call them the rich. And as for the
unfortunate fact that with us some of the unemployed are subjected to
inhuman suffering—the Russians match that by subjecting the kulaks, the
nobles, and the clergy to similar inhuman suffering.</p>
<p>The truth about the matter is that neither the things proposed in
previous depressions nor the economic planning proposed in this one is
capable of ending the insecurity from which we suffer.</p>
<p>Insecurity and industrialism are Siamese twins. You cannot have one
without having to accept the other.</p>
<p>Insecurity is the price we pay for our dependence upon industrialism
for the essentials of life.</p>
<p>A very old Biblical story makes it clear that when one man becomes
dependent upon another for the opportunity to secure the food with which
to keep himself alive, he may be forced to sacrifice his birthright of
freedom and happiness. Isaac, it will be remembered, was a wealthy man.
He had rich lands, large flocks, and many servants. Esau was his oldest
son and favorite. Custom made him his father’s exclusive heir. But he
was a reckless hunter, while his more conservative brother Jacob, who
coveted Esau’s birthright, was a farmer. The story of what happened to
Esau, as the Bible tells it, runs as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p> And Jacob had pottage.</p>
<p>And Esau came from the hunt, and he was faint.</p>
<p>And Esau said to Jacob: “Feed me, I pray thee, with that same pottage
for I am faint.”</p>
<p>And Jacob said, “Sell me this day thy birthright.”</p>
<p>And Esau said, “Behold I am at the point to die, and what profit
shall this birthright do me?”</p>
<p>And Jacob said, “Swear me this day.”</p>
<p>And Esau swore to him and sold his birthright unto Jacob.</p>
<p>Then Jacob gave Esau bread and pottage of lentils, and he did eat and
drink and rose up, and went his way.</p>
<p>Thus Esau lost his birthright.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Surely it is unnecessary to draw a moral. Surely it is plain that no
man can afford to be dependent upon some other man for the bare
necessities of life without running the risk of losing all that is most
precious to him. Yet that is precisely and exactly what most of us are
doing today. Everybody seems to be dependent upon some one else for the
opportunity to acquire the essentials of life. The factory-worker is
dependent upon the man who employs him; both of them are dependent upon
the salesmen and the retailers who sell the goods they make, and all of
them are dependent upon the consuming public, which may not want, or may
not be able, to buy what they may have made.</p>
<p>What the depression has done has been immensely to increase the evil
effects of this interdependence. What difference does it make to the man
who is unemployed why the demand for coal, or for automobiles, or for
cotton goods has fallen off? All he knows is that for some reason beyond
his control he has been laid off. If being laid off merely resulted in
his having to curtail his enjoyment of the luxuries of life, the
situation would be bad enough, but at least it would not be tragic. But
when being laid off means that he and his wife and children may be
deprived of food, when it means that they may find themselves without a
roof over their heads, when it means that they may be ragged and cold
and sick, except in so far as charity helps them—then you have stark,
staring tragedy.</p>
<p>Compare the position of the millions of men who are today unemployed
to the position of our pioneer forefathers of a hundred years ago. At
the beginning of the last century, Brillat-Savarin, the famous Frenchman
who wrote <em>The Physiology of Taste</em>, made a long visit to the
United States. In the fourth chapter of his book he tells the story of a
visit of several weeks which he made to a farm which is now within the
densely populated region of Hartford, Connecticut. As he was leaving,
his host took him aside and said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p> “You behold in me, my dear sir, a happy man, if there is one on
earth; everything you see around you, and what you have seen at my
house, is produced on my farm. These stockings have been knitted by my
daughters; my shoes and clothes came from my herds; they, with my garden
and my farmyard, supply me with plain and substantial food. The greatest
praise of our government is that in Connecticut there are thousands of
farmers quite as content as myself, and whose doors, like mine, are
never locked.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Today the farm on which that happy man once lived is cut up into city
streets and covered with city buildings. The men and women of Hartford
no longer produce their own food, clothing, and shelter. They work for
them in stores and offices and factories. And in that same city,
descendants of that pioneer farmer are probably walking the streets, not
knowing what to do in order to be able to secure food, clothing and
shelter.</p>

<h2>The New Frontier</h2>
<p>Since I made the study of homesteading for Dayton, Ohio, described in
Chapter 10, last winter, the First Homestead Unit of Dayton has become a
reality. A farm of 160 acres located about three miles from the city
limits has been purchased and laid out in three-acre plots; the old farm
buildings have been rehabilitated for use as a community center;
thirty-five families are now developing the tract, building homes, and
planting crops. It is possible, therefore, to add to this book a
detailed account based upon an actual rather than a theoretical
adventure in homesteading by a group of families developing the same
idea upon which the individual adventure of the Borsodi family was
predicated. The Dayton project is due mainly to the vision and
leadership of Dr. Elizabeth H. Nutting, the Executive Secretary of the
Character Building Division of the Council of Social Agencies of Dayton.
If I have hope for the success of this particular experiment, it is
primarily due to the fact that Dr. Nutting’s leadership is educational
in philosophy.</p>
<p>But Dr. Nutting could not have developed the project but for the
fortunate coincidence that Dayton possessed at the same time a group of
social-minded men and women in key positions in the city’s public life.
Outstanding in this group are Mrs. Virginia P. Wood, Chairman of the
Character Building Division of the Council of Social Agencies; Mr. Arch
Mandel, Executive Secretary of the Dayton Bureau of Community Service;
Mr. E. V. Stoecklein, Director of Public Welfare of the city; Mr. S. H.
Thai, of S. H. Thai, Inc., Chairman of the Homestead Committee; and
Mr. Walter Locke, editor of <em>The Dayton News</em>. Other members of
the Unit Committee of the Council of Social Agencies, as the group
sponsoring the movement is called, are the Rev. Charles Lyon Seasholes,
President of the committee, Pastor of the First Baptist Church; Mr. Wm.
A. Chryst, Consulting Engineer, Delco Products Company; Robert G.
Corwin, attorney, McMahon, Corwin, Landis and Markham, President of the
Council of Social Agencies; J. N. Garwood, Assembly Foreman, National
Cash Register Company; Mrs. Daisy T. Greene; Mr. W. A. Keyes,
Vice-President, Bureau of Community Service; Mrs. Mabel M. Pierce;
Mr. Frank D. Slutz, educator; Mr. N. M. Stanley, President, The Univis
Corporation; Mr. E. C. Wells, Vice-President, Platt Iron Works;
Gen. Geo. H. Wood, Veteran’s Administration, U. S. A. An advisory board
in accounting, agriculture, arts and crafts, engineering, health, home
economics, law, and education, including many nationally known
personalities, is assisting the committee. Under the chairmanship of
Dr. Harold Rugg of Columbia University, the national implications of the
Dayton experiment are being studied by a group interested in education
particularly from the standpoint of adult ed cation. This committee
includes Dr. C. F. Ansley of Columbia University, Dr. B. H. Bode of Ohio
State University, Dr. Wm. H. Kilpatrick of Columbia University, Dr. E.
C. Lindeman, New York School for Social Work, and Dr. H. A. Overstreet
of the College of the City of New York. Dr. Nutting and I are also
members of this group.</p>
<p>The self-sacrificing members of Dr. Nutting’s staff in starting the
movement should not be forgotten—Howard Keeler, production manager; T.
J. Wood, assistant production manager; Hazel Lehman, bookkeeper;
Margaret Hutchison, Hazel Boe, Alberta Tucker, secretaries. Their
willingness to work day and night and in most cases for no more than
“board and room,” has been one of the most important factors in the
development of this experiment.</p>
<p>An account of the movement which I wrote at the request of Freda
Kirchway, one of the editors of <em>The Nation</em>, and which appeared
in that magazine on April 19, 1933, is reprinted here because it
furnishes a compact summary of what took place up to that time.</p>
</section>
<section id="dayton-makes-social-history" class="level2">
<h2>Dayton makes social history</h2>
<p>“Dayton, Ohio, is setting the stage for an important economic,
social, and educational experiment. Out of the Production Units,
established in the summer of last year, is growing a movement to ring
the city of Dayton with what will be known as Homestead Units. The
Homestead Unit represents an attempt to solve the dilemmas of the
machine age along entirely new lines.</p>
<p>“In one respect the Dayton movement is quite different from the
hundreds of self-help, barter, and scrip movements which have sprung up
all over the country. It is an experiment in production for use as
against production for sale or exchange. From the very beginning the
leaders of the Dayton group have had in mind not only a temporary
solution for the problem of the unemployed but a permanently better way
of living for every man, woman, and child now struggling for happiness
in our industrial civilization.</p>
<p>“The original Production Units, of which there are now ten, are
located in various sections of the city. They now have a membership of
around 800 families and are the principal source of support of nearly
4,000 men, women, and children. The tenth unit was organized the week I
was in Dayton in the middle of January. A unit was also being organized
in one of the largest high schools in the city to include boys and girls
who have graduated from school and who now find that the jobs in
industry and business for which they spent years in training do not
exist. These younger folk, like the adults in the older units, are being
made to see this movement not merely as a stop-gap for the period of the
depression but as an entirely new way of living. More and more
Production Units will be established in the city and at the same time
the movement will be extended into the country.</p>
<p>“Superficially the Production Units are much like other groups in
which the unemployed are organized for self-help, though the Dayton
groups are smaller than most. The unit secures an empty house or store
for headquarters, acquires sewing machines, shoe-making machinery,
abandoned bakery ovens, and begins to make dresses and shirts, to bake
bread, to repair shoes, to cut wood. What the members of the group
cannot consume they trade to the city relief stores, to the farmers of
the surrounding country, and among themselves for foodstuffs, cloth, raw
materials, and other products. The Dayton plan is unlike most self-help
schemes in that barter is merely incidental. Within each unit,
distribution to the membership is made according to need, each member
being required to put in a certain amount of work. Usually the time
which the members devote to the unit is greatly in excess of the minimum
required. Volunteer work is common and a spirit of comradeship and
mutual helpfulness prevails.</p>
<p>“The limitations within which the Production Units operate are
obvious. In the city no raw materials can be produced. In order to
obtain cloth, raw wool, and groceries which they do not produce,
surpluses of clothing and bread and other products must be manufactured.
This requires large-scale operations and is dependent upon the unit’s
ability to secure factory machinery. These large-scale operations thrust
upon each organization problems of management actually much more
difficult than those in an average factory, because the management has
to be democratic. Politics, of course, arise. Revolutions within each
unit have taken place, though each has managed ultimately to develop
leadership and select a general manager and an executive committee
efficient enough to carry on. The larger the units become—that is, the
more nearly their operations approach factory proportions—the more
difficult become the problems of management and distribution. As long as
the units remain in the city and as long as they produce by factory
methods surpluses which they can exchange for the commodities they do
not make, they will have all the limitations under which cooperative
organizations generally labor. Only exceptional leadership will in my
opinion enable the units to maintain themselves when opportunities for
outside employment increase for the members.</p>
<p>“The Homestead Unit, the new experiment to which Dayton is now
committing itself as fast as suitable tracts of land can be secured and
the necessary funds raised, goes far beyond the Production Unit. In the
Homestead Units, which are to be located within a fifteen-mile radius of
the city, the families belonging to each unit will build their own homes
and grow their own crops in addition to carrying on the group activities
which the unit as a whole may decide on. Each tract will be owned by the
unit as a whole; the homesteads will be granted to members under
perpetual leaseholds and will consist of about three acres each. The
pasture, wood-lot, and community buildings will be owned by the unit and
used by the members under rules and regulations established by the whole
group. Each family in the unit is expected to build its own home,
poultry-house, cow-shed, and workshop; to cultivate a garden, set out an
orchard and berry patch, and become as nearly self-sufficient as were
the pioneers of a hundred years ago. Trades and crafts will be permitted
to develop toward specialization as far as the members desire, but there
will be no emphasis on specialization as a good in itself. Large-scale
farming operations may be carried on by the group as a unit, just as the
city units are now producing clothes, bread, and other goods.</p>
<p>“The plans presented for the first Homestead Unit look toward the
building of permanent and beautiful homes. The house walls will probably
be made of rammed earth. Cellars and garrets will be avoided and the
construction will be along lines developed by Ernest Flagg for beautiful
and inexpensive small homes. The homesteaders will commute between the
homesteads and their homes in Dayton while building the first wing of
their house. As soon as these wings are completed, they will move in and
begin to garden, to make their own furniture in their own workshops, to
weave cloth on their own looms, and to make their own clothes on their
own sewing machines. Electricity will be available not only for light
but for power. Machinery will be used to reduce drudgery to a minimum.
The crushing tax burden of elaborate water and sewerage systems will be
avoided by the use of individual automatic pumps and individual septic
tanks.</p>
<p>“Ambitious as this venture may sound from the standpoint of capital
required, the financial basis on which the project has been planned by
the responsible group of Dayton citizens who are backing it is entirely
sound. The funds to purchase the land and to build and equip the
homesteads—the labor being supplied by the members of each unit—are to
be lent to the units and to the homesteaders for a long term of years on
the building-and-loan-association plan. Advances will be made for
building material, for machinery, for tools, for live stock, and so on,
by a Finance Credit Committee of which General George H. Wood is
chairman. Part-time employment and the sale or exchange of any surplus
products will enable the homesteaders to repay the loans and keep intact
the revolving fund with which additional homesteads may be
established.</p>
<p>“One feature of the plan shows the foresight with which the whole
project is being launched. In order to prevent the possibility of
speculation in land either at present or at some future time, perpetual
leaseholds are to be substituted for the usual deeds to land. Thus all
the advantages which flow from individual use and individual ownership
of the homesteads will be retained, while injustices to the community
flowing from the withholding of the land allotted to any homesteader
from use will be prevented. The taxes levied upon the whole unit are to
be apportioned among the leaseholders in accordance with the value of
the piece of land leased to them.</p>
<p>“The outstanding fact about these homesteads is that they are
designed not only for family gardening but for family weaving and sewing
and family activities in all the crafts which have been neglected for so
many years. The loom room and the workshop, with all their opportunities
for self-expression and creative education, are once again to become
part of the American scene. They are being brought back to the home in
Dayton to fulfil the same functions that they fulfilled in the early
American home—to furnish economic independence, security, and
self-sufficiency. The tools and machines which will be used, however,
instead of duplicating, with false romanticism, the clumsy appliances of
pioneer days, will be modern and efficient. Power will be used both to
eliminate drudgery and to speed up production. Modern inventions will
supply comfort. The homestead will furnish the security of which
industrialism has deprived us. What I called domestic machinery in my
last book, in contrast to factory machinery, is to be given a chance to
free the unemployed of Dayton from their dependence upon industry and
make possible a higher standard of living than they ever before
enjoyed.</p>
<p>“Dayton is not waiting for economic planning in order to find some
way of taming the machine. It is decentralizing production, instead of
integrating it; and eliminating distribution costs by making the point
of production and the point of consumption one and the same. It is
making the home, rather than the factory, the economic center of life,
and turning to education, and the artist-teacher rather than to the
politician and the technical specialist for a way out. Dayton promises
to make social history. Something really new is emerging from its
struggle with the problem of relief.”</p>
<p>Since the above was written, the goal for the coming year in Dayton,
provided the necessary capital can be secured, is to establish fifty
Homestead Units to enable between 1,750 and 2,000 families to make
themselves self-sufficient and secure even under present-day depression
conditions. These units will form a ring around the city, as can be seen
from one of the drawings reproduced. While an effort will be made to
keep the units as close to the city as possible, the tentative limit set
by the committee is fifteen miles from the center of the city. Within
this limit, the homesteaders will be able to move back and forth between
their homes, and work, schools, theaters and stores in the city, with
comparative ease.</p>
<p>This expansion of the program for this year is being based mainly
upon the co-operation of some of the city’s largest industrial and
commercial enterprises which will aid in the selection of the families
and in spreading work so as to furnish some employment to families which
but for homesteading would be forced upon public relief. Some of the
families included in the first unit have already been on relief, and
will be taken entirely off relief as a result of this cooperation.
Living conditions for the homesteading families will be improved at the
same time that the burden upon the community for relief is reduced.</p>
<p>The financial plan upon which the First Homestead Unit is being
established, and which will be followed with all subsequent units,
begins with a loan by the Unit Committee of the Council of Social
Agencies, which is for all practical purposes in this connection a
mortgage-loan bank, to the First Homestead Unit for the purchase of the
land and farm buildings, the community machinery and road materials.
This loan is to be repaid to the committee over a period of fifteen
years. The original farm buildings on each tract purchased, which will
usually be farms of about 160 acres each, are to be converted by the
homesteaders into community buildings. After the community loan,
individual loans are made to each family for the building materials,
machinery, livestock and other equipment, and supplies needed for the
building of their homes, barns, and workshops, and for the operation of
the homesteads. The money for the loans to be made to the First
Homestead Unit is being secured locally through the sale of the first
issue of a series of Independence Bonds, bearing 4.5% interest and
maturing in fifteen years, and secured by all the property of the unit.
The capital for the subsequent units is to be secured by the issuance of
further series of Independence Bonds, except in so far as government aid
makes this unnecessary. Of course, the local situation is such that
without government aid the expansion of the homestead movement cannot
proceed as rapidly as hoped for. Application has therefore been made for
a loan of $2,500,000 from the Federal Emergency Relief Administration
and the Reconstruction Finance Corporation for this purpose.</p>
<p>The estimated expenditure for the fifty units, which will homestead
between 1,750 and 2,000 families of five persons each, is as

<p>With this development, a new frontier will have been established
around Dayton to which the enterprising, industrious, and ambitious
families shipwrecked in some way by the depression can migrate, just as
in all the great depressions of the past century, they migrated from the
industrial East to settle on the old frontier.</p>

<section id="extracts-from-the-constitution-of-the-first-homestead-unit" class="level2">
<h2>Extracts from the Constitution of the First Homestead Unit</h2>
<p>The preamble to the constitution tentatively adopted states clearly
the object of the members of the First Homestead Unit:</p>
<blockquote>
<p> We, the undersigned, in order to secure the opportunity to</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Satisfy our needs and desires directly by production for our own
use through intensive husbandry and home craftsmanship,</p></li>
<li><p>Achieve a permanent basis of economic independence and
security,</p></li>
<li><p>Develop a progressively higher standard of living,</p></li>
<li><p>Provide for our youth as soon as they are ready, and assure our
aged as long as they are able, participation in productive and creative
activities,</p></li>
<li><p>Enrich family and home life by reducing drudgery and releasing
creative activity through the use of domestic machinery,</p></li>
<li><p>Increase control over our own destinies by solving our problems
through simple family and neighborhood activities rather than through
large, complicated and impersonal civic and industrial relationships,
and</p></li>
<li><p>Furnish to the community of Dayton, which is assisting us to
establish ourselves on homesteads, an example of effectual and beautiful
living, do associate ourselves together to form a community of
homesteads and pledge ourselves to abide by the provisions of this
constitution.</p></li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p>The rights of the members to the development of a completely
individual life are safeguarded by the following provision:</p>
<p>The rights of the members to absolute freedom in religion, politics,
associations, production, and exchange shall never be abridged or
impaired by the Unit or its officers, and the only limit to the exercise
of the free will of the members shall be the equal rights of all others
to their freedom. Any such specific limitation shall be imposed only by
an affirmative vote of two-thirds of all members at a special meeting
called for that purpose.</p>
<p>The balance between what is communal and what is individual activity
is provided for in the following section:</p>
<p>Activities of the unit as a whole shall concern only those affairs
which from time to time by vote of the members shall be deemed to serve
better their economic or social good than can be achieved by individual
activity alone.</p>
<p>In order to prevent speculation in land, possession of the homesteads
is based upon a leasehold, the terms of which are made a part of the
constitution. The following is the lease agreement:</p>
<p>This agreement made this … day of … A.D. 19.., Witnesseth, that …
hereinafter collectively called the lessee, leases or lease jointly from
the Board of Directors of the First Homestead Unit of Dayton, Ohio,
Inc., the plot of land situated upon its lands in Jefferson Township,
Montgomery County, Ohio, which is designated on its official community
plan as Homestead Number …, containing about …. square feet, at a rental
of $…. until January first, next, and thereafter at such yearly rental,
payable in advance on the first day of January, as shall be assessed
against it by the Board of Directors of the Unit, subject, however, to
appeal to the membership of the Unit within one month at any regular
meeting of the Unit; this said assessment to equal as nearly as possible
the full annual rental value of the land excluding improvements
thereon.</p>
<p>All rentals so collected from the leaseholders shall be expended,
first, in the payment of all taxes levied by any authority of Ohio upon
the real estate and upon any tangible property located thereon, so that
all leaseholders shall be exempt and free of all such taxation;
secondly, in the payment of the interest upon the purchase mortgage upon
the land; thirdly, in payment on account upon the principal of the
purchase price of the land, and fourthly, any funds remaining from such
rentals, for such communal purposes as are properly public.</p>
<p>The said lessee may terminate this lease at any time by giving sixty
days notice to the Board of Directors of the Unit, and the said Board of
Directors, or their agent, may terminate this lease at any time on sixty
days notice if lessee shall fail to pay the rent at the time agreed
upon, or if the lessee or anyone for whom the lessee is responsible
shall make use of the land leased or the communal land in such a way as
shall be voted (by two-thirds of the members at a special meeting called
for the purpose), injurious to the rights of others.</p>
<p>Upon any termination of this lease except for arrears of rent, the
lessee may within thirty days remove or otherwise dispose of such
improvements as the lessee has provided, if the land is left in the same
condition as when the lease began. If the lessee fails to do so, then
the Unit shall dispose of the improvements at public auction, the net
proceeds of such sale, less all obligations of the lessee to the Unit,
to be turned over to the lessee.</p>
<p>If no such notice be given by the lessee to the Board of Directors,
or their agent, this lease shall continue from year to year upon the
same terms as above.</p>
<p>All rights and liabilities herein given to or imposed upon either of
the parties hereto shall extend to the heirs, executors, successors,
administrators and assigns of such party. In all leases of land, the
Unit reserves the right to resume the possession of the land for public
or community purposes upon payment of all damages sustained by the
lessee to be determined by three appraisers, one to be chosen by the
Board of Directors, one by the lessee, and the third by these two.</p>
<p>Nothing herein shall be construed to invalidate the Unit’s right to
eminent domain.</p>

<h2>A “City” of Refugee</h2>
<p>(From the editorial in <em>The Dayton News</em>, by Walter Locke,
vice President of the Unit Committee.)</p>
<p>“There are few cities where the independence of a certain sort of
citizen has not been brought into relief by the general difficulties of
the depression. In the environs of all cities there is the soil-loving
suburbanite. In some cases these are small farmers, market gardeners and
poultry raisers who try to make their entire living from their little
acres. More often and more successful there is a combination of rural
and city industry. Some member of the family, while the others grow
their crops, will have a job in town. A little money, where wages are
joined to the produce of the soil, goes a long way. Here the whole
family has work. The children, almost as soon as they are on their feet,
can do productive chores. Incidentally they gain in that process a
training and an essential education which city schools with difficulty
and only at considerable expense can supply. Here, too, when men grow
too old to keep the pace of the shops, there is work to do according to
their speed and strength.</p>
<p>“When the depression came most of these members of these suburban
families who held jobs in town were cut in wages and hours. In many
cases they entirely lost their jobs. What, then, did they do? Did they
have to resort to charity? The soil and the industries of their home
provided them a job; not a well paying job, of course, but work and a
living, however scant. Except for the comparatively few dollars required
for taxes and a few other items they were able, under their own sail, to
ride out the storm. The sailing was rough, perhaps; but not to be
compared with that in the wreck-strewn town.</p>
<p>“The story of ancient Israel tells how, in the old days of barbarian
justice, the”city of refuge” arose. The law of an eye for an eye and a
tooth for a tooth was still in vogue; but if an offender against his
neighbor could run fast enough to reach certain designated places known
as cities of refuge, he could lay claim to his life, at least till his
case could be examined on its merits.</p>
<p>“Farming as an exclusive business, a full means of livelihood, has
collapsed. Talk of ‘back to the farms,’ in this meaning, is in view of
the condition of the farmers, the sheerest nonsense, almost a crime.
Laboring as an exclusive means of livelihood has also collapsed. The
city laborer, wholly dependent on a job, is of all men most precariously
placed. Who, then, is for the moment safe and secure? The nearest to it
is this home and acres-owning family in between, which combines the two.
It is the only city of economic refuge anywhere in sight. Till industry
and agriculture can both, by a growth in wisdom, be made safe for
democracy, this half way place of refuge, the combination of the two
gives challenge to our thought.”</p>
