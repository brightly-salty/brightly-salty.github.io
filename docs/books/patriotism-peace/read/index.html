                    </header>
            <main><p>Dear Sir:—You write to me asking me to express
myself in respect to the United States of North America “in the
interests of Christian consistency and true peace,” and express the hope
that “the nations will soon awaken to the one means of securing national
peace.”</p>
<p>I harbour the same hope. I harbour the same hope, because the
blindness in our time of the nations that extol patriotism, bring up
their young generations in the superstition of patriotism, and, at the
same time, do not wish for the inevitable consequences of
patriotism,—war,—has, it seems to me, reached such a last stage that the
simplest reflection, which begs for utterance in the mouth of every
unprejudiced man, is sufficient, in order that men may see the crying
contradiction in which they are.</p>
<p>Frequently, when you ask children which they will choose of two
things which are incompatible, but which they want alike, they answer,
“Both.”</p>
<p>“Which do you want,—to go out driving or to stay at home?”—“Both,—go
out driving and stay at home.”</p>
<p>Just so the Christian nations answer the question which life puts to
them, as to which they will choose, patriotism or peace, they answer
“Both patriotism and peace,” though it is as impossible to unite
patriotism with peace, as at the same time to go out driving and stay at
home.</p>
<p>The other day there arose a difference between the United States and
England concerning the borders of Venezuela. Salisbury for some reason
did not agree to something; Cleveland wrote a message to the Senate;
from either side were raised patriotic warlike cries; a panic ensued
upon ’Change; people lost millions of pounds and of dollars; Edison
announced that he would invent engines with which it would be possible
to kill more men in an hour than Attila had killed in all his wars, and
both nations began energetically to arm themselves for war. But because,
simultaneously with these preparations for war, both in England and in
America, all kinds of literary men, princes, and statesmen began to
admonish their respective governments to abstain from war, saying that
the subject under discussion was not sufficiently important to begin a
war for, especially between two related Anglo-Saxon nations, speaking
the same language, who ought not to war among themselves, but ought
calmly to govern others; or because all kinds of bishops, archdeacons,
canons prayed and preached concerning the matter in all the churches; or
because neither side considered itself sufficiently prepared,—it
happened that there was no war just then. And people calmed down.</p>
<p>But a person has to have too little perspicacity not to see that the
causes which now are leading to a conflict between England and America
have remained the same, and that, if even the present conflict shall be
settled without a war, there will inevitably to-morrow or the day after
appear other conflicts, between England and Russia, between England and
Turkey, in all possible permutations, as they arise every day, and one
of these will lead to war.</p>
<p>If two armed men live side by side, having been impressed from
childhood with the idea that power, wealth, and glory are the highest
virtues, and that, therefore, to acquire power, wealth, and glory by
means of arms, to the detriment of other neighbouring possessors, is a
very praiseworthy matter, and if at the same time there is no moral,
religious, or political restraint for these men, is it not evident that
such people will always fight, that the normal relation between them
will be war? and that, if such people, having clutched one another, have
separated for awhile, they have done so only, as the French proverb
says, “<em>pour mieux sauter</em>” that is, they have separated to take
a better run, to throw themselves with greater fury upon one
another?</p>
<p>Strange is the egotism of private individuals, but the egotists of
private life are not armed, do not consider it right either to prepare
or use arms against their adversaries; the egotism of private
individuals is under the control of the political power and of public
opinion. A private person who with gun in his hand takes away his
neighbour’s cow, or a desyatma of his crop, will immediately be seized
by a policeman and put into prison. Besides, such a man will be
condemned by public opinion,— he will be called a thief and robber. It
is quite different with the states: they are all armed,—there is no
power over them, except the comical attempts at catching a bird by
pouring some salt on its tail,—attempts at establishing international
congresses, which, apparently, will never be accepted by the powerful
states (who are armed for the very purpose that they may not pay any
attention to any one), and, above all, public opinion, which rebukes
every act of violence in a private individual, extols, raises to the
virtue of patriotism every appropriation of what belong to others, for
the increase of the power of the country.</p>
<p>Open the newspapers for any period you may wish, and at any moment
you will see the black spot,—the cause of every possible war: now it is
Korea, now the Pamir, now the lands in Africa, now Abyssinia, now
Turkey, now Venezuela, now the Transvaal. The work of the robbers does
not stop for a moment, and here and there a small war, like an exchange
of shots in the cordon, is going on all the time, and the real war can
and will begin at any moment.</p>
<p>If an American wishes the preferential grandeur and well-being of
America above all other nations, and the same is desired for his state
by an Englishman, and a Russian, and a Turk, and a Dutchman, and an
Abyssinian, and a citizen of Venezuela and of the Transvaal, and an
Armenian, and a Pole, and a Bohemian, and all of them are convinced that
these desires need not only not be concealed or repressed, but should be
a matter of pride and be developed in themselves and in others; and if
the greatness and well-being of one country or nation cannot be obtained
except to the detriment of another nation, frequently of many countries
and nations,—how can war be avoided?</p>
<p>And so, not to have any war, it is not necessary to preach and pray
to God about peace, to persuade the English-speaking nations that they
ought to be friendly toward one another, in order to be able to rule
over other nations; to form double and triple alliances against one
another; to marry princes to princesses of other nations,—but to destroy
what produces war. But what produces war is the desire for an exclusive
good for one’s own nation,—what is called patriotism. And so to abolish
war, it is necessary to abolish patriotism, and to abolish patriotism,
it is necessary first to become convinced that it is an evil, and that
it is hard to do. Tell people that war is bad, and they will laugh at
you: who does not know that? Tell them that patriotism is bad, and the
majority of people will agree with you, but with a small proviso. “Yes,
bad patriotism is bad, but there is also another patriotism, the one we
adhere to.” But wherein this good patriotism consists no one can
explain. If good patriotism consists in not being acquisitive, as many
say, it is none the less retentive; that is, men want to retain what was
formerly acquired, since there is no country which was not based on
conquest, and it is impossible to retain what is conquered by any other
means than those by which it was acquired, that is, by violence and
murder. But even if patriotism is not retentive, it is restorative,—the
patriotism of the vanquished and oppressed nations, the Armenians,
Poles, Bohemians, Irish, and so forth. This patriotism is almost the
very worst, because it is the most enraged and demands the greatest
degree of violence.</p>
<p>Patriotism cannot be good. Why do not people say that egotism can be
good, though this may be asserted more easily, because egotism is a
natural sentiment, with which a man is born, while patriotism is an
unnatural sentiment, which is artificially inoculated in him?</p>
<p>It will be said: “Patriotism has united men in states and keeps up
the unity of the states.” But the men are already united in states,—the
work is all done: why should men now maintain an exclusive loyalty for
their state, when this loyalty produces calamities for all states and
nations? The same patriotism which produced the unification of men into
states is now destroying those states. If there were but one
patriotism,—the patriotism of none but the English,—it might be regarded
as unificatory or beneficent, but when, as now, there are American,
English, German, French, Russian patriotisms, all of them opposed to one
another, patriotism no longer unites, but disunites. To say that, if
patriotism was beneficent, by uniting men into states, as was the case
during its highest development in Greece and Rome, patriotism even now,
after eighteen hundred years of Christian life, is just as beneficent,
is the same as saying that, since the ploughing was useful and
beneficent for the field before the sowing, it will be as useful now,
after the crop has grown up.</p>
<p>It would be very well to retain patriotism in memory of the use which
it once had, as people preserve and retain the ancient monuments of
temples, mausoleums, and so forth. But the temples and mausoleums stand,
without causing any harm to men, while patriotism produces without
cessation innumerable calamities.</p>
<p>What now causes the Armenians and the Turks to suffer and cut each
other’s throats and act like wild beasts? “Why do England and Russia,
each of them concerned about her share of the inheritance from Turkey,
lie in wait and do not put a stop to the Armenian atrocities? Why do the
Abyssinians and Italians fight one another? Why did a terrible war come
very near breaking out on account of Venezuela, and now on account of
the Transvaal? And the Chino-Japanese War, and the Turkish, and the
German, and the French wars? And the rage of the subdued nations, the
Armenians, the Poles, the Irish? And the preparation for war by all the
nations? All that is the fruits of patriotism. Seas of blood have been
shed for the sake of this sentiment, and more blood will be shed for its
sake, if men do not free themselves from this outlived bit of
antiquity.</p>
<p>I have several times had occasion to write about patriotism, about
its absolute incompatibility, not only with the teaching of Christ in
its ideal sense, but even with the lowest demands of the morality of
Christian society, and every time my arguments have been met with
silence or with the supercilious hint that the ideas expressed by me
were Utopian expressions of mysticism, anarchism, and cosmopolitanism.
My ideas have frequently been repeated in a compressed form, and,
instead of retorting to them, it was added that it was nothing but
cosmopolitanism, as though this word “cosmopolitanism” unanswerably
overthrew all my arguments. Serious, old, clever, good men, who, above
all else, stand like the city on a hill, and who involuntarily guide the
masses by their example, make it appear that the legality and
beneficence of patriotism are so obvious and incontestable that it is
not worth while to answer the frivolous and senseless attacks upon this
sentiment, and the majority of men, who have since childhood been
deceived and infected by patriotism, take this supercilious silence to
be a most convincing proof, and continue to stick fast in their
ignorance.</p>
<p>And so those people who from their position can free the masses from
their calamities, and do not do so, commit a great sin.</p>
<p>The most terrible thing in the world is hypocrisy. There was good
reason why Christ once got angry,—that was against the hypocrisy of the
Pharisees.</p>
<p>But what was the hypocrisy of the Pharisees in comparison with the
hypocrisy of our time? In comparison with our men, the Pharisees were
the most truthful of men, and their art of hypocrisy was as child’s play
in comparison with the hypocrisy of our time; nor can it be otherwise.
Our whole life, with the profession of Christianity, the teaching of
humility and love, in connection with the life of an armed den of
robbers, can be nothing but one solid, terrible hypocrisy. It is very
convenient to profess a teaching at one end of which is Christian
sanctity and infallibility, and at the other—the pagan sword and
gallows, so that, when it is possible to impose or deceive by means of
sanctity, sanctity is put into effect, and when the deception does not
work, the sword and the gallows are put into effect. Such a teaching is
very convenient, but the time comes when this spider-web of lie is
dispersed, and it is no longer possible to continue to keep both, and it
is necessary to ally oneself with either one or the other. It is this
which is now getting to be the case in relation to the teaching about
patriotism.</p>
<p>Whether people want it or not, the question stands clearly before
humanity: how can that patriotism, from which result innumerable
physical and moral calamities of men, be necessary and a virtue? It is
indispensable to give an answer to this question.</p>
<p>It is necessary either to show that patriotism is such a great good
that it redeems all those terrible calamities which it produces in
humanity; or to recognize that patriotism is an evil, which must not
only not be inoculated in men and impressed upon them, but from which
also we must try to free ourselves at all cost.</p>
<p><em>C’est à prendre ou à laisser</em>, as the French say. If
patriotism is good, then Christianity, which gives peace, is an idle
dream, and the sooner this teaching is eradicated, the better. But if
Christianity really gives peace, and we really want peace, patriotism is
a survival from barbarous times, which must not only not be evoked and
educated, as we now do, but which must be eradicated by all means, by
means of preaching, persuasion, contempt, and ridicule. If Christianity
is the truth, and we wish to live in peace, we must not only have no
sympathy for the power of our country, but must even rejoice in its
weakening, and contribute to it. A Russian must rejoice when Poland, the
Baltic provinces, Finland, Armenia, are separated from Russia and made
free; and an Englishman must similarly rejoice in relation to Ireland,
Australia, India, and the other colonies, and cooperate in it, because,
the greater the country, the more evil and cruel is its patriotism, and
the greater is the amount of the suffering on which its power is based.
And so, if we actually want to be what we profess, we must not, as we do
now, wish for the increase of our country, but wish for its diminution
and weakening, and contribute to it with all our means. And thus must we
educate the younger generations: we must bring up the younger
generations in such a way that, as it is now disgraceful for a young man
to manifest his coarse egotism, for example, by eating every thing up,
without leaving anything for others, to push a weaker person down from
the road, in order to pass by himself, to take away by force what
another needs, it should be just as disgraceful to wish for the increase
of his country’s power; and, as it now is considered stupid and
ridiculous for a person to praise himself, it should be considered
stupid to extol one’s nation, as is now done in various lying patriotic
histories, pictures, monuments, textbooks, articles, sermons, and stupid
national hymns. But it must be understood that so long as we are going
to extol patriotism and educate the younger generations in it, we shall
have armaments, which ruin the physical and spiritual life of the
nations, and wars, terrible, horrible wars, like those for which we are
preparing ourselves, and into the circle of which we are introducing,
corrupting them with our patriotism, the new, terrible fighters of the
distant East.</p>
<p>Emperor William, one of the most comical persons of our time, orator,
poet, musician, dramatic writer, and artist, and, above all, patriot,
has lately painted a picture representing all the nations of Europe with
swords, standing at the seashore and, at the indication of Archangel
Michael, looking at the sitting figures of Buddha and Confucius in the
distance. According to William’s intention, this should mean that the
nations of Europe ought to unite in order to defend themselves against
the peril which is proceeding from there. He is quite right from his
coarse, pagan, patriotic point of view, which is eighteen hundred years
behind the times. The European nations, forgetting Christ, have in the
name of their patriotism more and more irritated these peaceful nations,
and have taught them patriotism and war, and have now irritated them so
much that, indeed, if Japan and China will as fully forget the teachings
of Buddha and of Confucius as we have forgotten the teaching of Christ,
they will soon learn the art of killing people (they learn these things
quickly, as Japan has proved), and, being fearless, agile, strong, and
populous, they will inevitably very soon make of the countries of
Europe, if Europe does not invent something stronger than guns and
Edison’s inventions, what the countries of Europe are making of Africa.
“The disciple is not above his master: but every one that is perfect
shall be as his master” (Luke 6:40).</p>
<p>In reply to a prince’s question how to increase his army, in order to
conquer a southern tribe which did not submit to him, Confucius replied:
“Destroy all thy army, and use the money, which thou art wasting now on
the army, on the enlightenment of thy people and on the improvement of
agriculture, and the southern tribe will drive away its prince and will
submit to thy rule without war.”</p>
<p>Thus taught Confucius, whom we are advised to fear. But we, having
forgotten Christ’s teaching, having renounced it, wish to vanquish the
nations by force, and thus are only preparing for ourselves new and
stronger enemies than our neighbours. A friend of mine, who saw
William’s picture, said: “The picture is beautiful, only it does not at
all represent what the legend says. It means that Archangel Michael
shows to all the governments of Europe, which are represented as robbers
bedecked with arms, what it is that will cause their ruin and
annihilation, namely, the meekness of Buddha and the wisdom of
Confucius.” He might have added, “And the humility of Lao-tse.”</p>
<p>Indeed, we, thanks to our hypocrisy, have forgotten Christ to such an
extent, have so squeezed out of our life everything Christian, that the
teachings of Buddha and Confucius stand incomparably higher than that
beastly patriotism, by which our so-called Christian nations are guided.
And so the salvation of Europe and of the Christian world at large does
not consist in this, that, bedecking themselves with swords, as William
has represented them, they should, like robbers, cast themselves upon
their brothers beyond the sea, in order to kill them, but, on the
contrary, they should renounce the survival of barbarous
times,—patriotism,—and, having renounced it, should take off their arms
and show the Eastern nations, not an example of savage patriotism and
beastliness, but an example of brotherly love, which Christ has taught
us.</p>
