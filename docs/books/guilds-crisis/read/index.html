<h1>Preface</h1>
<p>This book is, among other things, an attempt to formulate a policy
for Guildsmen in the event of a revolution. Prophecy is always
dangerous, and it is, of course, conceivable that a sudden enlightenment
might descend upon the governing class of this country such as would
enable them to steer safely through the social rapids which lie ahead.
It must be confessed, however, that such a miracle is highly improbable,
considering that they do riot apparently possess sufficient
understanding to retain the loyalty of such a naturally conservative
body of men as the police. Prudence, therefore, suggests the wisdom of
accepting revolution as inevitable, and of shaping Guild policy in the
light of it, in order that we may not be taken by surprise. For
revolution is at the same time a great opportunity and a great danger.
If it should come upon us while we are unprepared, it is almost a
certainty we should drift into anarchy. On the other hand, if
anticipated, it might be used for the purposes of reconstruction.</p>
<p>The circumstance that, owing to the excesses of the Bolshevik regime
in Russia, the idea oi revolution is no longer popular in this country
does not affect the position one iota. For revolutions are not definite
political acts which owe their origin to a more or less temporary mood
of the people, but are forced upon people by the fact that a particular
political and economic system has reached a deadlock. For when normal
activities can no longer find an outlet there is bound to come a
bursting of barriers. Such an impasse, I hope to show, is bound to
follow the economic policy of the Government, which may be summarized in
the term “Maximum production.” It is a policy which must either issue in
revolution or other wars, which if the public allow could be used to
relieve the pressure of the markets by the creation of a demand for
armaments. It has been said that Governments are never overthrown, but
that they commit suicide, and, frankly confessed, our Government seems
impelled by a kind of fate towards such an ending.</p>
<p>As the assumption underlying my arguments is that Germany will not
repay our War Loan, it is necessary to point out that even if she were
made to pay, the crisis would not be averted. In this event we should
have to provide her with work, and this would react to increase
unemployment in this country. I wish it were otherwise, for justice
demands that Germany should be made to suffer; but I cannot overlook the
fact that its economic reaction upon ourselves would be as unfavourable
as the introduction of slaves was to the freemen of the Roman
Empire.</p>
<p>It remains for me to thank the Editor of the <em>New Age</em> for
permission to reprint the two concluding chapters.</p>

<h1>The Economic Cul-de-sac</h1>
<p>In spite of the repeated assurances of Cabinet Ministers and others
that things after the war are going to be very different from what they
were before, there is little either in their words or actions to suggest
that they have any idea of what the forthcoming changes are likely to
be. Though they talk a great deal about reconstruction, and have set up
a Ministry of Reconstruction to elaborate plans for our guidance in the
future, it becomes more evident every day that it is readjustment rather
than reconstruction that engages their attention There is nothing either
in the general principles laid down for the guidance of the Committees
set up by the Ministry,or in such of their reports as have already come
to hand, to suggest that the governing class are in any way conscious of
the need of reconstruction. On the contrary, all the reports agree in
taking existing society in its main essentials for granted as a thing of
permanence and stability, little suspecting the real peril that
confronts us and seeking only to effect such detailed adjustments as
they suppose are necessary to enable society to recover from the shock
and dislocations occasioned by the war. One of the Committees only that
concerned with the Labour Unrest shows any sign of alarm, while even
here there is little or no suspicion that the trouble is irremovable so
long as industrialism exists. On the contrary, the trouble is regarded
merely as a form of distemper to be remedied by the balm and plaster of
the Whitley Report.</p>
<p>While making this general comment on the work of the Ministry, I must
not be interpreted as deprecating entirely the work of the Committees.
The problems of demobilization and the supply and distribution of raw
materials are problems of fundamental importance, though they partake of
the nature of readjustment rather than of reconstruction. However much
our eyes are fixed on the future, however much we may be persuaded that
the only way to avoid catastrophe is finally to take such measures to
strengthen the base of society as are involved in a return to first
principles, the fact remains that we must live from day to day during
the period of transition. And in order that we may so live, in order
that the economic reaction of the war may not precipitate anarchy,
society as it exists to-day must be propped up. To such an extent the
work of the Committees is valuable, and to such an extent the various
systems of control which are being introduced into so many departments
of production and distribution are to be approved, even though they do
involve bureaucratic methods of administration. If the temporary nature
of these arrangements be admitted, then no harm can come of them. The
danger is that these props, instead of being regarded as scaffolding
necessary to the rebuilding of society, should be mistaken for permanent
structural arrangements, for they touch no vital social issue. Though at
the moment they put a boundary to the growth of anarchy, they do not
seek to remove its cause, and no scheme which does not seek first and
foremost to remove the cause of social anarchy is worthy of the name of
reconstruction.</p>
<p>That readjustment rather than reconstruction was the aim of the
Ministry is apparent not only from the terms of reference to the
Committees, but from their manner of setting to work. Had reconstruction
been their aim, they would not immediately have set up a number of
Committees to deal with the various aspects of the problem presented,
but would have sought first to establish some general unanimity of
opinion as to its cause. It was, I suppose, because they regarded the
war as a colossal accident rather than as the goal towards which
industrialism inevitably tended that they made no such effort. And this
is where they went astray. If the war were entirely due to the personal
ambition of the Kaiser and the lust for conquest of the Pan-Germans,
then there would be no more to be said. But if on inquiry we find there
to be causes much more fundamental and intimately connected with the
economic expansion to which industrialism had committed all the nations
of the West, the situation wears a very different complexion. For it
will then be seen that readjustment is not only insufficient to meet the
perfectly legitimate demands of labour, but cannot even save the
governing class itself from complete annihilation in the near
future.</p>
<p>In such circumstances it becomes apparent that if a scheme of
reconstruction is to be formulated which shall be in relation to the
facts of the case, we must make our starting-point an inquiry into the
causes of the war, and in this connection it will be convenient to begin
with the Kaiser and his personal responsibility. Evidence seems to point
to the fact that though the Kaiser’s arrogant and bombastic spirit was a
great factor in the development of the war spirit in Germany, yet at the
last moment he was reluctant to sign the declaration of war. The Kaiser
is evidently a weak man, and had doubtless to screw his courage up to
take the final step, as is evidenced by the testimony of Dr. Mühlon,
formerly a director of Krupps, who has told the world the story of how r
early in July 1914 the Kaiser informed Herr Krupp von Bohlen that he
would declare war as soon as Russia mobilized, adding “and this time the
people would see that he would not turn back.”</p>
<p>That is conclusive. But there is a question arising out of this. Why
did the Kaiser say “this time”? It had reference to the Agadir crisis of
1911, when the Kaiser came to an agreement with France over matters in
dispute in Morocco without having occasion to resort to war. This
pacific act of the Kaiser did not please the Pan-Germans, who denounced
him in the Berlin Press as a coward and a traitor, and so, being a weak
man, he yielded to their clamour. But why did the Pan-Germans desire
war?</p>
<p>Prince Lichnowsky has told us that when the British Government showed
the utmost readiness to meet the wishes of Germany in its desire for
colonial expansion and a treaty defining the respective spheres of
influence of the two Powers had been arranged, the German Government
refused to sign it upon the only terms on which Sir Edward Grey would
become a party to it—namely, that it should be given publicity. The
answer is, of course, that as the Pan-Germans desired war under all
circumstances and determined that nothing should stand in its way, they
deprecated the publication 6f a treaty which would have knocked the
bottom out of their propaganda. Had the treaty been published, it would
have been impossible publicly to maintain the theory that Germany was
surrounded by a world of enemies, cut off from any peaceful expansion by
the envious jealousy and the encirclement policy of British
statesmen.</p>
<p>But why did the Pan-Germans desire war apparently under any
circumstances? The usual answer is, of course, to say that Germany was
ambitious, desired world dominion, that she had become so saturated with
the spirit of war and conquest that she had become incapable of thinking
politically except in the terms of war. While this undoubtedly was the
case, it does not explain why war broke out in 1914 instead of before,
for such a spirit had been present in Germany since 1871. The reason is,
I think, to be found in the economic condition at which Germany had then
arrived. The financial strain in Germany in the three or four years
preceding the war had become so terrible that it is conceivable that the
war was as much caused by the desire, for relief from such trying
circumstances as by the warlike proclivities of the German ruling class.
German trade had been built up upon a highly organized system of credit;
and as that system showed signs of breaking down, German statesmen and
financiers apparently had come to the conclusion that the only way to
save the country from financial disaster was to secure the huge
indemnities which would follow upon a successful war. That is the
reason, I believe, why Germany refused to sign the treaty with Great
Britain. It was because its statesmen felt that while it would make war
impossible, it would not solve the economic problem with which Germany
was confronted in 1914.</p>
<p>Before the outbreak of the war the joint-stock system of banking in
Germany was in a very rotten condition. Germany was trading upon a
broadly extended system of credit, controlled through the Reichsbank by
the Government. Under the Reichsbank flourished a system of four hundred
and twenty-one joint-stock banks. In February 1914 the ninety-one
principal joints-tock banks had owing to them from various debtors
6,068,000,000 marks, while their indebtedness was 8,600,000,000 marks,
or in other words, they were insolvent—a fact which is not surprising
when we learn the highly speculative nature of the enterprises which
they were accustomed to finance. The stability hitherto of the English
banks rests on the fact that they can only invest in gilt-edged
securities. But the German banks would apparently finance anything, no
matter how speculative. Many of them had been heavily engaged in
promoting doubtful ventures at home and abroad, such as the building of
railways in Russia, Asia Minor and South America, while in order to
encourage German export trade they were accustomed to grant long credits
to foreign customers without near prospects of payment. It w r as by
such means that Germany had hoped to secure the commercial hegemony of
the world. But she had overreached herself. The system was clearly
breaking down.</p>
<p>It will be unnecessary for me to go deeply into this matter, but a
moment or two spent over the greatest of the joint-stock banks—the
Deutschebank—will be worth while. “On paper this limited company, which
must not be mistaken for the Imperial State Bank, is an imposing
institution. Its securities and reserves amount to 425,000,000 marks, or
21,000,000, of which 250,000,000 marks are capital and 175,000,000
reserve, figures which will compare reasonably well with one or other of
the smaller joint-stock banks of this country or of France. But where
the English joint-stock banks or the Credit-Lyonnais, let us say, are
largely institutions of deposit, doing only very conservative financial
business, the Deutschebank, which has lately absorbed the
Bergisch-Marckischebank, employs the greater part of its capital and its
resources in speculations of a very doubtful type, or definitely and
absolutely employs the deposits entrusted to it for political ends or
the extension of German interests. In Turkey, for instance, the
Deutschebank has employed itself in the building of railways, in the
farming of the octrois; in Berlin it has attempted to found a petroleum
monopoly under the control of the Government, and it has advanced more
than 100,000,000 marks for the purpose of saving the
Fuersten-Conzern.</p>
<p>“This Princes-Concern was an immense syndicate of princes and
courtiers who were determined to obtain their share of the industrial
development of Germany. They built hotels, factories, immense shops,
where they traded in every possible article of commerce; they speculated
in building land; and last year (1914) the whole concern came to the
ground with an immense crash, threatening with absolute ruin several of
the princely houses of Germany. That the Deutschebank should have tried
to come to the rescue of this concern was nothing more or less than
dishonesty to its depositors, or, if that is too strong a statement, it
is exact to say that at the date of the outbreak of the war the
Deutschebank, in spite of its advance of 100,000,000 marks, was very far
from having established the Fuersten-Conzern on anything like a
satisfactory basis.”</p>
<p>Corroborative testimony to the economic depression which had
overtaken Germany prior to the war is to be found in the Reports of
H.B.M.’s Consular Agents in Germany. Reading them makes it fairly
apparent that by the end of 1912 the German industrial system had
reached its limit of expansion, and that the competition of French,
Japanese, English, and Scotch manufacturers was either closing markets
to the Germans, or was actually making inroads in the German home trade,
and it becomes evident that the German financial system, built on an
inverted pyramid of credit, could not for long bear the strain of
adverse conditions. Germany was committed to a policy of indefinite
industrial expansion, and signs were not wanting that that expansion had
reached its limit. Professor Hausertells us in this connection that the
ratio of productivity, due to never-slackening energy, technique and
scientific development, was before the war far outstripping the ratio of
demand. Production was no longer controlled by demand, but by plant.
What the Americans call overhead expenses had increased to such an
enormous extent that no furnace could be damped down and no machine
stopped, or the overhead expenses would eat up the profits, and the
whole industrial organization come crashing down, bringing with it
national bankruptcy. In other words, the commercial history of the
German Empire was one of enormous artificial expansion obtained not
infrequently by cutting prices to such an extent that there were no
available profits when the expansions were secured. Since the opening
years of the present century the whole financial position of Germany
has, in fact, been one of long anxieties, qualified by short periods of
hectic confidence.</p>
<p>But, it will be said, if the German economic system was really
breaking down before the war, how is it that she has been able to
finance the war for four years? For if such had been the case, would not
the strain of the war have broken it down long ago?</p>
<p>The answer is that though in the long run the continuance of war
tends to wreck every economic system, its immediate effects may be
otherwise, inasmuch as the exigencies of war can be used by an
all-powerful Government to perpetuate a financial system which is moving
towards bankruptcy by changing temporarily the basis on which it rests.
Let me explain how this works.</p>
<p>It will not be disputed that under normal peace conditions every
financial system rests upon confidence. The maintenance of this
confidence In these days rests upon an ability to make profits, for it
is only by making profits that interest on loans and other financial
obligations can be met. Should the pressure of competition become so
severe that the margin of profit is reduced beyond the point at which
obligations can be met, confidence goes, and if the great majority of
people in a community are in these difficult straits economic stagnation
results. Such a state of things might exist in a society in which a
small minority of the community was very wealthy. Economic stagnation in
such circumstances would not mean that there was not wealth in a
country, but that the possessors of wealth withhold their money from
circulation because they cannot see a return for their capital. The
evidence I have given appears to show that some such state of financial
stagnation had overtaken Germany in the two years preceding the war.
Competition had become so keen and profits so reduced that confidence
had been largely destroyed, and money withdrawn from circulation. But
once war was declared the system began to work again, because finance
rested no longer on confidence but on force. In other words, war
introduced a change in financial operations to the extent that
confidence came to rest no longer upon personal solvency, but upon
Government solvency, which in turn rested upon faith in German arms to
secure huge war indemnities at the conclusion of peace. Realizing the
root trouble in German finance, namely, small profits which disposed the
possessors of wealth to withhold money from circulation, I do not see
how war indemnities could provide a remedy. But that is by the way. The
important thing was the German people thought so, and that set the
financial machine in motion again.</p>
<p>Enjoying this illusion, the possessors of wealth, who in peace times
withheld their money from circulation because they could see no return
for it, lent it to the Government when it declared war, partly out of
fear, lest if they did not support the Government their country might be
invaded or they might be compelled to acquiesce in an unfavourable
peace, but primarily because the Government promised them interest on
their loans. Further, under the plea of urgency to which the war gave
justification, the credit of the German subject was propped up by the
Government, which, acting through the Reichsbank, put a value by fiat on
securities which are now unsaleable, and can only have value on the
hypothesis of a German victory: values on German business concerns
abroad sequestrated and possibly to be confiscated, values of
concessions that may never be returned to Germany, values of export
houses that may never be able to regain their markets, values of ships
seized or sunk, etc. By placing a credit value on such securities, the
Government could borrow money. The expenditure of these loans by the
Government put money into circulation, which the German Government
borrowed again from the people into whose hands it had passed, paying
the interest out of further borrowing. This process could be continued
so long as the belief persisted that the country would be ultimately
victorious, and it took a long time to destroy this belief, for by the
exercise of arbitrary power the German Government had managed to merge
with its shaky structure of public credit the whole structure of private
credit as well. The limit is only reached when the accumulations of
interest to be paid cannot be met out of further borrowings.</p>
<p>It will be with the return of peace that the real troubles will
begin. This will be not merely because of the political and financial
complications which will arise in every belligerent country over the
repayment of their war loans, and the problems of demobilization and
unemployment, but because the economic lesson which the war should have
taught has not been heeded. The war is still regarded by most people as
a colossal accident, a stupendous misfortune which has overtaken the
world. Individual thinkers here and there have seen its connection with
industrialism, have seen that the war was precipitated by the fact that
industrialism, at least in Germany, had reached its limit of expansion.
But nowhere is there any public recognition of the fact, and this is
where the danger lies. For it is certain that the whole of Western
civilization was travelling in the same direction, and, apart from the
war, would soon have found itself in this same economic cul-de-sac, from
which the only escape is backwards. It is a paradox, but it is
nevertheless true, that what we term expansion ends finally in
congestion. The congestion which for so long followed every attempt to
break the line in France symbolizes the congestion which has entered
into every department of modern activity. Everything in modern life is
congested—our politics, our trade, our professions and cities have one
thing in common: they are all congested. There is no elbow-room
anywhere, and, as I have said, there can be but one path of escape, and
that is backwards.</p>
<p>Modern thinkers, although they will sometimes admit that many things
in life have their limits, nevertheless find it difficult to believe
that there is such a thing as a limit to economic development. Somehow
or other they imagine that economic expansion can go on for ever, and
deny absolutely the possibility of such a thing as an economic deadlock
overtaking industry. I believe that a terrible disillusionment awaits
them, for events very soon after the war will prove my contention in a
way more forcible than logic unless, of course, in the meantime .the
danger is clearly recognized and measures are taken for meeting it.
Judging by the trend of opinion, such a course seems extremely
unlikely.</p>
<p>Let me try to show why industrial expansion must eventuate in an
economic deadlock. I will begin by defining an economic deadlock as a
state of affairs in which the balance between demand and supply is so
completely upset that only changes so drastic and fundamental as to
amount to a revolution can by any possibility restore it again. What is
there improbable about such a situation arising? The balance has been
upset many times during the last hundred years, and after a time it is
true things have adjusted themselves again. But what reason is there to
suppose that the balance will always be restored, any more than to
suppose that because a man has recovered several times from some serious
illness he will always be able to offer effective resistance? We know
that such is not the case, and that the constant recurrence of illness
will so weaken a man’s constitution that in the end he succumbs. The
same holds good with respect to economic evils which attack the body
politic. They undermine this and undermine that until finally they bring
disaster. That this is not popularly recognized is due to the long
period of time which elapses between the first symptoms and the final
catastrophe. When the evil first appears it gives rise to alarm. People
predict dreadful consequences, and they are right, but the delay seems
to disprove them. Familiarity breeds indifference. Then apologists
appear, and the various stages of the disease are heralded as signs of
progress, until finally all ideas of right and wrong become so confused
that when the final crisis arrives the foundations of right thinking
have become so completely undermined that nothing can prevent
collapse.</p>
<p>Let me argue the point another way. If there is no limit to the
possibilities of production there must be no limit to consumption,
because the volume of production can only increase on the assumption
that there is a corresponding increase in consumption. But is it not
apparent that there must be a limit to the possibilities of consumption?
If by automatic machinery we could increase production a thousandfold
the balance between demand and supply would be upset and an economic
deadlock created, for it is a certainty we could not increase our
consumption to a corresponding degree, except by recourse to a war a
thousandfold more destructive than the present one.</p>
<p>That is the answer, I think, to those people who agree in theory that
there is a limit to consumption, but deny that we are in any way
reaching this limit. The proof that there is such a thing as a limit to
consumption lies in the fact that we are at war. We are at war to
decide, among other things, which nation or group of nations shall have
the right to dominate the markets of the world. If the limit of
consumption has not been reached, why should there be this struggle, why
this intensification of competition? Surely it can only mean that,
having reached this limit, we are in an economic cul-de-sac, that we are
unable to go forward and too proud to go back.</p>

<h1>Maximum Production and Scientific Management</h1>
<p>THE underlying cause of the destruction of the balance between demand
and supply, which in turn has been the economic cause of the war and
will lead us afterwards into an economic cul-de-sac, is the sin of
avarice, which leads people to be for ever reinvesting their surplus
wealth for further increase instead of spending it upon crafts and
arts.</p>
<p>This mania—for it is nothing less—is of quite modern origin. In the
Middle Ages, as in the East to-day, it was the custom of people to spend
or invest their wealth in beautiful things. They would spend their all
upon fine buildings, furniture, metal-work, rugs, or jewellery.
Incidentally, this is why people who were poor according to modern
standards invariably lived in a beautiful environment. It was natural
for these people to spend their wealth in this way because when the laws
against usury were strict there was no other way to spend it. But with
the relaxation of the Mediaeval laws against usury, and the rise of
Protestantism, which sought to accommodate morals to the practice of the
rich, a change gradually took place. Still, in spite of gross
inequalities in the division of wealth, the balance between demand and
supply was fairly maintained, since, so long as hand production
obtained, a natural boundary prevented the growing tendency of people to
reinvest surplus wealth for further increase from developing beyond a
certain point. But with the coming of machinery and the limited
liability company this boundary was removed, and opportunities for
investment presented themselves at every turn. It was thus that the old
idea that surplus wealth should be spent upon the arts first fell into
disuse, and then was forgotten. When people build nowadays they no
longer regard it as a means of consuming a surplus, but as a speculation
by which they hope to increase their riches. This applies not only to
building, but to pictures, which are bought to-day as investments.</p>
<p>Had the governing class any grip of the economic situation, they
would have seized upon this issue as being the central one for
themselves, and by diverting surplus wealth into its proper channel have
sought to readjust the balance between demand and supply. But in spite
of all that has happened, and is happening, they seem to be entirely
blind to the situation. They never for one moment reflect on the general
economic situation, which in their minds appears to be entirely obscured
by two issues considered by them of more immediate importance, namely,
how to secure our commercial supremacy after the war against the
competition of Germany, and how to repay the war loan. Being practical
men—that is, men who can never see the wood for the trees—they
concentrate on these two issues, disregarding entirely the wider
considerations involved. Faced, apparently, by a dilemma and seeing no
sure path of escape, they close their eyes to half of the facts of the
situation and plunge wildly forward in a desperate bid for safety. How
else can the advocacy of maximum production and scientific management be
explained? If it is not a policy of desperation, what is it? For no one
could advocate it who has made any attempt to see the problem as a
whole. It is a gambler’s last throw with the dice loaded against
him.</p>
<p>I feel well advised in making this assertion, for all the facts of
the situation point to this conclusion. The advocates of maximum
production and scientific management make no attempt to think as
statesmen who take all sides of a problem into consideration; they do
not even think of the class interests of capitalists, for maximum
production can be shown to be contrary to their interests as a class;
they think as individual capitalists who interpret national problems in
the terms of their own businesses. There can be no doubt about this, for
it is only by thinking in such terms that it is possible to make out a
case for these proposed innovations. Their reasoning is arcadian in its
simplicity. To repay the war loan and to maintain our commercial
supremacy after the war, it is necessary to make more money and to
produce more cheaply. These ends are to be attained by maximum
production on a basis of scientific management. What could be simpler?
Scientific management will reduce the cost of production, and will
therefore allow us to compete more successfully with Germany, while
maximum production increases opportunities for the making of profits.
Such a policy is without doubt a sound business proposition from the
point of view of the individual capitalist who has to consider ways and
means of holding his own in the market and meeting his financial
obligations after the war. But it is not possible for many of them to
adopt it without imperilling the stability of the whole social and
economic system. For it has this defect, when considered from a national
point of view, that it increases immeasurably the discrepancy between
demand and supply. It trespasses further on the margin of economic
safety. In a word, it is a proposal to take a short cut by sailing too
near the wind, and as after the war the political and economic
atmosphere will be charged with storms and tempests, the chances are
that the ship of state will capsize.</p>
<p>To realize the danger of this proposal it is only necessary to
enlarge the area of the problem. Granted that maximum production and
scientific management would enable our manufacturers to produce more
cheaply and to make more money, would it enable them to give more
employment? For unemployment is going to be the problem of problems
after the war, and a policy which does not make this issue its
starting-point is no policy at all. It is an evasion of the whole
difficulty. In comparison, how to repay the war loan, and how to
maintain our position in the markets of the world are matters of quite
secondary importance, since the whole future of our civilization depends
upon our capacity to deal successfully with unemployment. Failure means
not only revolution, but a relapse into anarchy and barbarism.</p>
<p>“But,” it will be said by the advocates of this insane policy,
“making good the shortage which has been occasioned by the war, the
revival of agriculture, protection for home markets, and bounties for
key industries will provide work for some time to come, and so there is
no immediate danger. Unemployment there probably will be, but it will
not be of such dimensions as to imperil the stability of society.” To
which I answer that though by such means we may put off the evil day,
they leave the central problem essentially unaltered. The reason for
this is to be found by again enlarging its area. For the problem is
really an international one. All the other belligerent nations will have
to face the same problems as ourselves. If we adopt maximum production,
they in turn will be compelled to adopt it in self-defence, while in so
far as by means of Protection and bounties we encourage home industries
at the expense of foreign ones, the result will be a decreased
purchasing power in other nations, which in turn will deprive us of
markets for our surplus goods. On this issue the Free Trade argument is
perfectly sound. I am in favour of Protection for other reasons—for
military and political reasons, and because apart from it the regulation
of our internal economic arrangements will remain impossible. But the
idea that by means of Protection our volume of trade can be increased
appears to me to be altogether illusory.</p>
<p>I said that if we adopt maximum production other nations will be
compelled to do the same in self-defence. Where shall we be then? The
competition will be more severe than ever. Profits will decline, and how
is that going to help us to repay the war loan? So that finally we see
that maximum production defeats its own ends, even from the point of
view of its promoters. Sooner or later the truth will have to be faced
(and the sooner the better) that the only way to repay the war loan is
to effect such a radical revolution in our methods of taxation as w r
ill enable the wealthy class to liquidate the debt among themselves. All
efforts of the wealthy to evade their responsibilities by attempts to
shift the burden on to the shoulders of other classes must in the nature
of things not only fail in the end, but will be accompanied by a measure
of retribution that they will not easily forget. The new world, it is
true, is going to be different from the old, but it rests with the
wealthy class whether the transition is going to be one of orderly
progression or revolution. For if it be true, as I have already shown,
that industrialism before the war had reached its limit of expansion,
then it follows that the reorganization of industry on a basis of
scientific management must be accompanied by the growth of a permanently
unemployed class—a class which tends gradually to increase. For, as the
whole underlying basis of modern industry is one of expansion, it
follows that once the limit is reached, contraction must take its place.
Here again there will be no stopping the tendency, once it gets fairly
in motion, apart from a return to those first principles of social
organization which we abandoned four hundred years ago.</p>
<p>While maximum production is calculated to make trouble for us in the
markets, scientific management will make trouble for us in the workshop.
It is not a policy calculated to pour oil on troubled waters, but rather
to add fuel to the flames of discontent. For the moment appearances are
to the contrary. Labour Ministers have been brought into line, and are
doing their best to induce the workers to scrap their old prejudices in
favour of limitation of output, while holding out promises of increased
earnings if they will join hands with the employers in an effort to
increase the volume of production by accepting scientific management.
But promises are one thing and fulfilment is another. The workers’
instinct in favour of limiting output is not altogether a prejudice,
though it may appear as such to capitalists and others. On the contrary,
it is born of experience, and an experience not to be gainsaid. The
workers know that such a policy keeps them employed, whereas when more
than the average is produced the markets are glutted and unemployment
results. This has been the experience of the maximum production policy
in America, where a factory will work at full pressure for several
months and then close down until its surplus stock can be disposed of.
It is experiences of this kind which have led the American Labour Unions
to adopt an attitude of uncompromising hostility towards scientific
management. It may be possible for our Labour Ministers to persuade the
workers to give it a trial. But they will not acquiesce for long, for
the old difficulties will soon reappear, and then the old troubles will
begin again.</p>
<p>But there are other and deeper reasons for the hostility of labour.
Scientific management irritates the workers. They dislike the kind of
supervision which it entails. Labour is essentially human and does not
care about being scientifically managed. Its idea is to manage industry
some day itself, and so it naturally looks with suspicion upon a system
which proposes to deprive the worker of what remains of his skill and to
transfer all labour knowledge to the management. For scientific
management is a good scavenger. It is out for every scrap of trade
knowledge it can get. Following the machine, it proposes to clean up the
last vestiges of craftsmanship, and to put the ship-shape touches to
modern industry, “Each one of these ‘scientific’ propositions is
perfectly familiar to the workman in spite of the rather naive assurance
of the efficiency engineers that they are new. He has known them in
slightly different guise for a century past. The new thing is the
proposition to develop what has been in the past the tricks of the trade
into a principle of production. Scientific management logically follows,
and completes the factory process.”</p>
<p>It is important to note that it <em>completes</em> the factory
process. As such it is a cul-de-sac. Mr. J. A. Hobson, in an article on
scientific management, brings home the truth of that assertion.
“Indeed,” he says, “were the full rigour of scientific management to be
applied throughout the staple industries, not only would the human costs
of labour appear to be enhanced, but progress in the industrial arts
itself would probably be damaged. For the whole strain of progress would
be thrown upon the scientific manager and the consulting psychologist.
The large assistance given to technical intervention by the observation
and experiments of intelligent workmen, the constant flow of suggestion
for detailed improvements would cease. The elements of creative work
still surviving in most creative labour would disappear. On the one hand
there would be small bodies of efficient taskmasters carefully
administering the orders of expert managers; on the other, large masses
of physically efficient but mentally inert executive machines. Though
the productivity of existing industrial processes might be greatly
increased by this economy, the future of industrial progress might be
imperilled. For not only would the arts of invention and improvement be
confined to the few, but the mechanization of the great mass of workmen
would render them less capable of adapting their labour to any other
method than that to which they had been drilled. Again, such automatism
in the workers would react injuriously upon their character as
consumers, damaging their capacity to get full human gain out of any
higher remuneration that they might obtain. It would also injure them as
citizens, disabling them from taking an intelligent part in the arts of
political self-government. For industrial servitude is inimical to
political liberty. It would become more difficult than now for a
majority of men, accustomed in their workday to mechanical obedience, to
stand up in their capacity as citizens against their industrial rulers
when, as often happens, upon critical occasions, political interests
correspond with economic cleavages.”</p>
<p>There is one comment to make on this quotation. Mr. Hobson’s
reference to “large masses of physically efficient executive machines”
does not receive medical support. <em>American Medicine</em> comments
editorially on the result to labour of efficiency schemes designed to
relieve it of “wasted” effort.</p>
<p>“Working along with his partner the efficiency engineer, the
speeder-up has managed to obtain from the factory worker a larger output
in the same period of time. This is done by eliminating the so-called
superfluous motions of the arms and lingers i.e. those which do not
contribute directly to the fashioning of the article under process of
manufacture… The movements thought to be superfluous simply represent
Nature’s attempt to rest the strained and tired muscles. Whenever the
muscles of the arms and fingers, or of any part of the body for that
matter, undertake to do a definite piece of work, it is physiologically
imperative that they do not accomplish it by the shortest mathematical
route. A rigid to-and-fro movement is possible only to machinery;
muscles necessarily move in curves, and that is why grace is
characteristic of muscular movement and is absent from a machine. The
more finished the technique of a workman and the greater his strength,
the more graceful are his movements, and, what is more important in this
connection, vice versa. A certain flourish, superfluous only to the
untrained eye, is absolutely characteristic to the efficient workman’s
motions.</p>
<p>“Speeding-up eliminates grace and the curved movements of
physiological repose, and thus induces an irresistible fatigue, first in
small muscles, second in the trunk, ultimately in the brain and nervous
system. The early result is a fagged and spiritless worker of the very
sort that the speeder-up’s partner—the efficiency engineer—will be
anxious to replace by a younger and fresher candidate, who, in his turn,
will soon follow his predecessor if the same relentless process is
enforced.</p>
<p>“It will always be necessary to consider workers as human beings, and
charity and moderation in the exaction of results will usually be found
the part of wisdom, as representing a wise economy of resources. This
scientific charity, however, is something quite apart from the moral
effect on the personnel of due recognition of their long service, and of
loyalty which is likely to accompany it.”</p>
<p>So after all it appears that the workers’ prejudice is not altogether
without some foundation, and as it so happens that the workers are
masters oi the position to the extent that they must be willing to
co-operate with the efficiency engineer if a scheme is to be evolved
suitable to a particular trade, the pill has to be gilded if they are to
swallow it. This is the secret of the bonus system and promises of high
wages, as it is doubtless the secret of the Whitley scheme. For,
according to Mr. F. W. Taylor, its pioneer, scientific management
requires of industry a new ethical standard, and involves a complete
revolution both on the part of the management and the men. But if I am
not mistaken, the anxiety of our new industrialists to introduce this
new ethical standard is a case of crying peace, peace, when there is no
peace. For industrialism has exhibited disruptive tendencies since the
day of its birth—disruptive tendencies which have hitherto only been
held in check by the military organization. But for the military,
industrialism could never have been introduced. The Luddite
anti-machinery riots bear witness to the opposition that had to be
overcome, while every stage of its development has been punctuated by
the military on whose assistance capitalists have been able to rely in
their warfare with the workers for the suppression of riots which
developed out of strikes. So there is a sense in which it may be
affirmed that industrialism and militarism rest to-day on a common
foundation. The war, as I have already shown, was precipitated by the
economic crisis which had overtaken industrialism in Germany. The idea
that militarism could be abolished and industrialism retained is quite
illusory. For if militarism went, a check would be removed which so far
has prevented industrialism from bearing its bitterest fruit. The
workers would rise against its tyranny if they felt that they no longer
need submit, and it looks as if scientific management would bring the
trouble to an issue. Under the new dispensation it is to play the part
of <em>agent provocateur</em> until the workers rise and rebel.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, there is some consolation in the fact that as every
industrialized nation after the war will be confronted by the same
problems, all the nations involved in the struggle are learning the same
lesson at the same time. All of them will discover that industrialism is
a cul-de-sac from which the only escape is backwards. There is reason
therefore to hope that beneath the fierce and cruel oppositions of the
hour a profound principle of unity is at work, and that when after the
war the dream of a glorified industrialism is dispelled, common action
may be taken to put an end not only to militarism, but also to the
industrial warfare of which it is the bitter fruit.</p>

<section id="the-return-to-mediaevalism" class="level1">
<h1>The Return to Mediaevalism</h1>
<p>A consideration of the issues raised in the foregoing chapters points
to the conclusion that capitalism is about to commit suicide. Having
reared the industrial system upon a basis of social and economic
injustice, capitalists are driven from one desperate expedient to
another in a vain effort to attain economic, stability. But these
efforts will avail nothing, for the crisis ahead cannot be met by men
whose primary interest is in maintaining the capitalist system. Hence
their dilemma.</p>
<p>It is because industrialism is finally based upon social injustice
that the balance between demand and supply has been upset For this
phenomenon is but the reflection in the economic sphere of the
destruction of the balance of power in the body politic which followed
the destruction of the Guilds at the time of the Reformation, when the
people lost control of those things which immediately affected their
lives. Uncontrolled by Guilds, industry could no longer be related to
human needs. It became subject to mass movements entirely incapable of
control by any human agency whatsoever, whether collective or
individual, and it has gone on floundering ever since, while Parliament,
which came to usurp all power in the State, has in turn been drawn into
the sweep of these invisible world-currents.</p>
<p>In one sense it is true to say that the present state of things marks
a condition into which civilization has drifted, and is the result of no
policy, no forethought, no design. And yet in another sense this is not
true. The modern State has become what it is because for the last four
hundred years the governing class have sought to perpetuate the
injustices established by the Reformation. It was because the governing
class was living on the plunder of the monasteries and the Guilds that
they were in the past led to blacken Catholicism, to condone usury, to
misrepresent the Guilds and to give support to .false political and
economic theories. They did this because in no other way could they
justify themselves. While they denied the people the right to manage
their own affairs through the agency of Guilds—the only institution
through which the people are capable of exercising control—they found
that they themselves were unable to control the economic situation. When
they found that their meddling only made matters worse, they came to
drift, to adopt the policy of <em>laissez-faire</em>, which the force of
circumstances has brought to an end, but which leaves them in a sad
dilemma. For whereas things have reached such a pass that something must
be done, they find that not only are they without any rational social
theory to guide them in the task of reconstruction, but that the
prejudice against Mediaeval society which has been created by lying
historians in the past stands in their way, because it has led men to
look with suspicion upon all normal social arrangements. In rejecting
the Guild, political philosophers denied the chief corner stone of any
sane political theory, and have in consequence been driven into error
after error and into compromise after compromise in a vain endeavour to
find solutions to problems which for minds with their perverted outlook
are insoluble.</p>
<p>To Mediaeval social arrangements we shall return, not only because we
shall never be able to regain complete control over the economic forces
in society except through the agency of restored Guilds, but because it
is imperative to return to a simpler state of society. Further
development along present lines can only lead to anarchy. For anarchy is
the product of complexity. It comes about in this way: the growth of
complexity leads to confusion, because when any society develops beyond
a certain point the human mind is unable to get a grip of all the
details necessary to its proper ordering. Confusion leads to
misunderstandings and suspicions, and these things engender a spirit of
anarchy. No one will deny that such a spirit is rife to-day, and it is
difficult to avoid the conclusion that it is a sign that modern society
is beginning to break up. We are certainly beginning to turn the corner,
and once it is turned there will be no stopping until we get back to the
Mediaeval basis. We shall travel of course by stages. But we shall get
there eventually because we shall find no rest, no stability, until we
reach our destination. There will be no stopping at any half-way house;
so much is certain.</p>
<p>Meanwhile it is interesting to note how Mediaeval economic principles
are insinuating themselves into latter-day practice as a consequence of
the force of circumstances. We have not yet attained to the Mediaeval
conception of a Just Price, but the necessity of putting a boundary to
the depredations of the profiteer has revived its Mediaeval
corollary–the Fixed Price. Being a practical people with machinery as
our god, we indignantly repudiate the idea that it is in the interests
of society that machinery be controlled. Yet all the same machinery is
being controlled in Lancashire and Yorkshire to-day—it is true as
measures of war emergency consequent upon the shortage of cotton and
wool, but it is none the less significant on that account; for if the
war is not to be regarded as a colossal accident but as something
towards which the whole modern polity inevitably tended then we may be
sure that the forces at work which make control necessary to-day will
make it necessary in the future. The cotton shortage may come to an end;
but Lancashire is losing its Indian market because of an adverse tariff,
as indeed it is losing other markets through the growth of
competition—circumstances which bring home to us the fact that
industrialism has reached its limit of expansion. Wisdom might have
suggested years ago the desirability of regulating the output of cotton.
For it would surely have been better to have introduced such regulations
than to be for ever lowering the standard of quality in order to adjust
the balance between demand and supply which the use of an
ever-increasing number of spindles necessitated. Is it not strange that
nothing short of a war of universal dimensions could induce Lancashire
to face up to the situation? I should like to believe that wars would be
impossible in the future, but the unwillingness or inability of mankind
to face the simple facts of society apart from them does not leave much
room for hope.</p>
<p>The examples I have given of the tendency of latter-day economic
practice to follow Mediaeval lines are interesting, but the strongest
evidence of all in support of the hypothesis that a return to
Mediaevalism is essential to the preservation of society is to be found
in the success of the National Guild movement which proposes to
transform the Trade Unions into Guilds. For there is historical
continuity in the idea, inasmuch as the Trade Unions are the legitimate
successors of the Mediaeval Guilds, not only because the issues with
which they have concerned themselves have arisen as a result of the
suppression of the Guilds, but because they acknowledge in their
organization a corresponding principle of growth. The Unions to-day with
their elaborate organizations exercise many of the functions which were
formerly performed by the Guilds—such as the regulation of wages and
hours of labour, in addition to the more social duty of giving timely
help to the sick and unfortunate. Like the Guilds, the Unions have grown
from small beginnings until they now control whole trades. Like the
Guilds also, they are not political creations, but voluntary
organizations which have arisen spontaneously to protect the weaker
members of society against the oppression of the more powerful. They
differ from the Guilds only to the extent that, not being in possession
of industry and of corresponding privileges, they are unable to accept
responsibility for the quality of work done and to regulate the prices,
The National Guild proposal therefore to transform the Trade Unions into
Guilds by giving them a monopoly of industry is thus seen to be an
effort to give conscious direction to a movement which hitherto has been
entirely instinctive—which is, to use Mr. Chesterton’s words, “a return
to the past by men ignorant of the past, like the subconscious action of
some man who has lost his memory.”And the propaganda has met with a
phenomenal success—a success which I have some right to say has been out
of all proportion to the amount of work put into it or the means at the
disposal of its advocates, and which therefore can only be finally
explained on the assumption that it voices a felt need; that the balance
of power in society has become so upset that men instinctively support
the Guild idea as a means of restoring the equilibrium.</p>
<p>It is safe to say that the Guild propaganda would not have been
followed with the success it has had but for the co-operation of certain
external happenings. In the first place there is the growing distrust of
Parliament and centralized government. In the next there is the
increasing sense of personal insecurity and loss of personal
independence which has followed the growth of large organizations. Then
there is the war and the Munitions Act, which gave the workers a taste
of Collectivism and the enormous growth of bureaucracy, which has
brought home to many people the utter inadequacy of such a method for
meeting really vital problems. In consequence almost everybody has come
to feel that some fundamental change must be made, and as the road
forward is impassable, there is no alternative but to go back. I am
aware of course that many National Guildsmen would not go to such
lengths. Their concern is with the problem of transforming the Unions
into Guilds, which they can justify as going forward. All the same it is
a step backwards of a very fundamental order, for it is nothing less
than a proposal to reverse the practice and judgment of the last four
hundred years. I say “practice and judgment,” but I place practice first
because I do not seriously think that the present state of things owes
its existence to any reasoned judgment whatsoever. It was established
first by force and attempted justifications were made afterwards. That
is the history of all modern ideas.</p>
<p>We may agree with the National Guildsmen that the first step is for
the workers to take over the control of industry, and that in order to
do this they must for the present accept industry as it actually exists.
<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> But if they are not to be involved
in the catastrophe which threatens the modern world, they should be
sufficiently frank with themselves to know in what direction we are
travelling; for there will be no time to discuss properly the issues
involved when the transfer actually takes place. One fundamental
issue—the incompatibility of democratic control with highly centralized
organization—is being realized, so there is nothing to fear in that
direction. No difficulties are likely to be put in the way of the growth
of local autonomy. The trouble is likely to come over the unemployed
problem which will certainly follow the demobilization of the forces and
the closing down of the munition factories in spite of the shortage
which must be made good. National Guildsmen will be as powerless as
capitalists to face this problem unless in the meantime they make up
their minds in what direction society is travelling.Socialists generally
have not emancipated themselves entirely from Capitalist ways of
thinking. Almost without exception they still think about finance in
commercial terms, while Guildsmen have not always learned to think
primarily in the terms of things. Yet Guild finance must differ as
fundamentally from commercial finance as Guild organization differs from
commercial organization. To make a long story short, Guild finance means
the abolition of finance as we understand it. For finance to-day means
nothing more than finding ways and means of using money for the purposes
of increase, and obviously Guilds can have nothing to do with such a
motive. It follows that in proportion as the Guild principle of fixed
prices can be applied, opportunities for making money by the
manipulation of exchange will tend to disappear, while in proportion as
the workers come into the possession of industry, opportunities for
investment will likewise come to an end. Bookkeeping there will be, but
bookkeeping is not what we understand by finance. From this point of
view the primary aim of the Guild is to guard society against the evils
of an unregulated currency by restricting currency to its legitimate use
as a medium of exchange.</p>

<li id="fn1" role="doc-endnote"><p>Something approximating to National

workers to elect to their Workshop and Factory Committees not those best

</ol>
</section>
<p>The introduction of a change so fundamental in the conduct of
industry will create a host of problems with which it will be necessary
to deal. For with the change many occupations will automatically come to
an end, and if society is not to relapse speedily into anarchy it is
important that the situation should be intelligently anticipated. All
who find themselves unemployed should be put upon free rations until
such time arrives as they can become absorbed in the new social system.
There is no other way of preventing bloodshed. Meanwhile the surplus
workers should be put upon the land, for not only would this measure
have the merit of immediately relieving the situation, but the revival
of agriculture would confer the permanent benefit of strengthening
society at its base, while it would react to restore normal conditions
in industry. Of course some discrimination would need to be shown, as in
the case of old people who would be unable to adjust themselves to the
new conditions and should be pensioned off.</p>
<p>While the revival of agriculture would relieve the unemployed
problem, it would by no means solve it. Such a <em>desideratum</em> can
only be reached by such a complete change in the purpose and scope of
industry as is involved in the substitution of a qualitative for the
present quantitative ideal of industry. This is a big question, and
presupposes a revolution not only in our methods of production but in
our ways of thinking, habits of life and personal expenditure. As I have
discussed this question and its implications at some length in my
<em>Old Worlds for New</em>,[^5] it will not be necessary for me to
repeat the argument I there used. Suffice it here only to say that such
a change in concrete terms means the revival of handicraft together with
a definite limitation of the use of machinery. That the revival of
handicraft would assist us in our efforts to cope with the unemployed
problem becomes apparent when we realize that with a reversion to
handicraft we should no longer be haunted by the problem of surplus
goods which has followed in the wake of unregulated machine production.
Anyway it is apparent that if men are unemployed they must either be
provided for or left to starve. Would it not be wiser to employ them as
handicraftsmen than to compel them to live on doles while being employed
on some useless and unnecessary work? This issue must be faced. It
cannot be evaded any longer, because nowadays, when there are no new
markets left to exploit, it will be impossible to put off the evil day
by dumping our surplus products in foreign markets.</p>
<p>To ordinary sane men such reasoning is conclusive. Unfortunately,
however, the decision in such matters does not rest with them to-day,
but with the “politically educated” members of society—that is with men
whose natural instincts have been perverted by the training of their
minds on false issues in the supposed interests of capitalists and the
<em>status quo</em>. That Socialists and Labour men generally are just
as much victims of our false academic tradition as members of the
governing class does not lessen but increases the danger, for by
depriving the working class of their natural leaders, it is surely
bringing about the rule of the mob. It is tragic, but still it is
nevertheless true to say that, generally speaking, the more highly
educated a man is to-day the more likely he is to be wrong. This is the
secret of the power of the Northcliffe Press, of the Billing verdict, as
of the impotence of our governing class. The feeling against leaders,
rightly interpreted, is really a demand for leaders whose instincts are
sound. The good men believe the wrong things. That is our root trouble
to-day.</p>

<section id="the-spiritual-change" class="level1">
<h1>The Spiritual Change</h1>
<p>The danger inherent in the growing disrespect for all forms of
authority is that from being a perfectly legitimate protest against
spurious forms of authority and culture it may develop into a revolt
against authority and culture in general. To the Neo-Marxist whose faith
is absolute in the materialist interpretation of history this may seem a
matter of no consequence. But to those who realize the dependence of a
healthy social system on living traditions of culture it is a matter of
some concern. For whereas a false culture like the academic one of
to-day tends to separate people by dividing them in classes and groups
and finally isolating them as individuals, a true culture like the great
cultures of the past unites them by the creation of a common bond of
sympathy and understanding between the various members of the
community.</p>
<p>The recovery of such a culture is one of our most urgent needs, for
some such unifying principle is needed if society is to be
reconstituted. If the overthrow of capitalism is not to be followed by
anarchy, this dual nature of the social problem must be acknowledged.
For it is apparent that if a change in the economic system is to be made
permanent it will need to be accompanied and fortified by a change in
the spirit of man. Most Socialist activity to-day is based upon the
assumption that one will necessarily follow more or less automatically
as a consequence of the other, and that all it is necessary to do is to
seek to abolish economic insecurity under a restored Guild system and
the materialist spirit would disappear as a matter of course. But such
reasoning, I submit, is fallacious. Even granting that it could be
proved that the social problem had its origin in a purely economic
cause, it does not follow that to effect economic change in the right
direction would automatically produce the change we desire on the
spiritual side of life, because, as we are all creatures of habit, the
materialist habit of mind would tend to persist when the cause which
originally created it had been removed. What most Socialists fail to
realize is that the material and spiritual sides of the problem must be
attacked simultaneously if reaction is not to result. Otherwise it is a
certainty that the one which at the moment is left standing would wreck
the other. We know that a religious revival to-day would not effect
permanent results unless it were accompanied by a change in the economic
system. For precisely the same reason a change in the economic system
cannot be permanent unless accompanied by a corresponding change in the
spirit of man. Apart from a change in the spirit of man, it is
conceivable that a restored Guild system, instead of laying the basis of
a happy and prosperous society, would, under materialist direction,
degenerate into a number of warring groups, in which the groups in an
economically weak position would be ground down by those in a stronger
one. All the circumstances which now so rightly shock the Socialist
conscience would be reproduced. The tree would still only bear thistles,
for self-interested human nature must ever inflict suffering on those
that are weak. Economic change is therefore impotent to redeem society
unless it is accompanied by such a change in the spirit of man as is
tantamount to a religious awakening, “For,” to quote de Maeztu, “men
cannot unite immediately among one another; they unite in things, in
common values, in common ends.”The materialist philosophy of organized
Socialism supplies no common aim capable of uniting men for the purposes
of reconstruction; on the contrary, it can only unite them for the
purposes of destruction, for the overthrow of the existing system. Once
that is done, Socialists must split up among themselves, for their lives
are governed by no common denominator. Like the builders of Babel, they
will be overtaken by a confusion of tongues—for such is the inevitable
end of all materialist systems.</p>
<p>The more one thinks about the social problem the more one comes to
see that economic health in a community is dependent upon morals; and
the more one thinks about morals the more one comes to realize that
their roots are finally to be found in religious conviction. Brotherhood
is only possible on the assumption that evil motives can be kept in
subjection, and the experience of history seems to prove that only a
religion which appeals to the heart and conscience of men is capable of
this. If evil motives can be kept in subjection, then the kingdom of God
upon earth can be realized, but on no other terms. This, I take it, was
the central truth and purpose of Christianity throughout its great
historic period. By strengthening man it sought to establish and fortify
the normal in life and society. That Christians at times have been drawn
to other ideals is true, but that the central aim of Christianity was
the establishment of the kingdom of God upon earth the wonderful
architecture and social organization of the Middle Ages bears
witness.</p>
<p>We have moved so far away from the Middle Ages that it is difficult
for us to conceive of life as it was then lived or religion as it was
then understood. Religion then was not a thing to be indulged in by
people who had a bias in that direction and ignored by others—something
apart from life with little or no influence on the main current of
affairs—but was the creative force at the centre of society; the
mainspring and guiding principle that shaped art, politics, business and
all other activities to a common end. It was moreover a culture which
united king and peasant, craftsman and priest in a common bond of
sympathy and understanding; for, unlike modern culture, it did not
depend upon books and so did not raise an intellectual barrier between
the literate and the illiterate, but united all, however varying the
extent of their knowledge and understanding. The mason who carved the
ornaments of a chapel or cathedral drew his inspiration from the same
source of religious tradition as the ploughman who sang as he worked in
the field or the minstrel who chanted a story in the evening. Modern
education at the best is a poor substitute for the old culture which
came to a man at his work. The utmost it can do is to give us an
opportunity of reading in books descriptions of a beautiful life which
once existed in reality. And let us never forget that the central
mystery around which this life moved was religion. This fact is the last
one the modernists are willing to admit. They may be fascinated by the
glamour and romance of the Middle Ages, by its wonderful architecture
and its social organization. But it may be said of them what Mr.
Chesterton said of Ruskin, “that he wanted all parts of the cathedral
except the altar.”</p>
<p>In accounting for the changes which destroyed Mediaeval Society and
inaugurated the modern world, it is customary in economic circles to
ascribe them to the Reformation and the Great Pillage which accompanied
it. But the Reformation itself was the consequence of that many-sided
movement which we know as the Renaissance which in turn was the direct
consequence of that awakened interest in Greek and Roman literature,
science and art in the fourteenth century in Italy which followed the
Revival of Learning. So that when we search for the impulse which first
set in motion the forces which have created the modern world we find it
in the labour of scholars who ransacked libraries in their enthusiasm
for the culture of the pagan world.</p>
<p>The immediate results of their labour were full of promise. The
rediscovery of the literature and art of the ancient world had a
wonderfully stimulating effect on the imagination of Europe, inclining
as it did at the beginning to give a certain added grace and refinement
to the vigorous traditions of Mediaevalism. It seemed, indeed, for a
time as if the Renaissance was really what its name implies—a
rebirth—and that life itself, casting off the fetters which bound it,
was to come to its own at last. But it was not to be. Early in the
sixteenth century its morning splendour in Italy received a check, and
as time wore on it became more and more evident that the glories of the
Renaissance were over and that its tyrannies had begun. For what
happened in Italy happened wherever it succeeded in establishing itself.
Its immediate effect was always that of a stimulant which for a time
quickened things into a vigorous life. After this reaction set in. A
kind of staleness overcame everything. Mankind suffered spiritual
atrophy. Religion and art withered as a consequence of the forces set in
motion, and in spite of attempted revivals, I’ve never succeeded in
becoming properly rooted again, nor will they ever do so until the false
values which the Renaissance imposed upon the world are banished. For,
briefly, it may be said that the fundamental error of the Renaissance
was that it everywhere concentrated attention upon secondary things to
the neglect of the primary ones. In its enthusiasm for learning it came
to exalt knowledge above wisdom, science above religion, mechanism above
art. The misdirection of energy which has followed these false
valuations has literally turned the world upside down, so that, like a
pyramid balanced upon its apex, it remains in a state of unstable
equilibrium. For there can be no peace so long as the major powers which
alone are capable of giving direction to society are subjected to the
caprice and domination of the minor ones.</p>
<p>It is a fact not without significance that science alone has profited
by the changes associated with the Renaissance. I say it is not without
significance because science is not a creative but a destructive force.
Let there be no mistake about this. Science always destroys. There are
of course some things—disease, for instance—which need to be destroyed,
and in destroying these science does useful work. But the usefulness of
science is strictly limited. As the handmaid of religion and art its
services may be invaluable. For it is their function to know the
<em>why</em> of things, whereas science only concerns itself with the
<em>how</em>. And in a healthy society the <em>why</em> would take
precedence to the <em>how</em>. When this natural order is reversed and
science assumes the leadership, society lives in peril of its existence.
For the liberation of natural forces which science aims at effecting is
to liberate forces which man is powerless to control. It is no accident
that science has become the servant of militarism. Too proud to accept
spiritual direction, it was left no choice in the matter.</p>
<p>The materialist spirit which science has helped to engender shows
itself irreconcilably hostile to all the higher interests of mankind.
All men who care for spiritual things are conscious of this antagonism.
But hitherto opinion has been divided as to the best means of combating
it. Feeling themselves more or less powerless in the face of the vast
mechanism of industrialism, many such men are inclined to take the view
that industrialism must be accepted to-day as an established fact, and
urge upon all who are conscious of its limitations to seek to supplant
its materialist direction by a spiritual one. This view, which has the
advantage of appearing broad and magnanimous, has the further one of
reconciling men temporarily to the servitude to which they must submit.
Nevertheless, it is both impracticable and fallacious. The very
magnitude of the industrial system forbids it, thus making of our would
be industrial reformers utterly impracticable dreamers. Small machines
may be used by man, but large machinery acquires a will of its own. The
men who direct it soon find out that they can only remain solvent on the
assumption that they are willing to sacrifice everything to the
all-absorbing interest of keeping the vast machinery in commission.
Hence it comes about that it is the tendency of industrialism to throw
out all men who are unwilling to bend their will to the will of the
machine. It is in the nature of things that this should be so. For there
are only two possible lines of development. Either industry must be
brought into relation with what we regard as the permanent needs of
human nature, or human nature is not to be regarded as a fixed quantity
and must adapt itself to the needs of industry. There is no third
position such as the proposed spiritual control of industrialism would
suggest.</p>
<p>Though there exists to-day an undoubted antagonism between the
material and spiritual sides of life, it has not always been so. Whether
such antagonism exists or not is all a matter of proportion. Up to a
certain point in the development of civilization no antagonism is felt.
The material and spiritual aspects of life go hand in hand. But beyond a
certain point this is no longer the case. Separation begins. Henceforth
further development of one side can only be at the expense of the other.
It is not a case of any one definitely willing this separation. It
simply happens as a loss of balance consequent upon an undue
concentration upon the problems appertaining to one side of life. In
this sense things are to be regarded not as necessarily good or bad in
themselves, but may be either according to the proportion they bear to
each other. As in chemistry we know that the elements composing any
compound substance will combine with others in a certain definite and
fixed proportion, and in no other, so it appears that in society the
material and spiritual elements can only combine organically when they
co-exist in a certain definite proportion.</p>
<p>Exactly what that proportion is it is impossible in words to say.
What, however, we do know is that the material side of life is to-day
abnormally over-developed while the spiritual side is to an equal extent
under-developed, and this is sufficient for practical purposes. For our
business being to restore the balance now destroyed, we are right in
supporting whatsoever tends to increase spiritual activities on the one
hand and to limit material ones on the other. In reality, however, this
is not two forms of activity but one, inasmuch as both reforms must
proceed simultaneously. The material development is to-day so
overwhelming and its force is so irresistible that there can be no such
thing as a widespread spiritual reawakening so long as the material
crust in which our life is embedded remains unimpaired. That crust will
need to be broken before the spirit of man can move freely again, and
there is every reason to believe it will be broken before long. For the
determination of the Government, capitalists and others to carry the
industrial system after the war to its logical conclusion is the surest
way of ending it, for all the contradictions which now underlie our
civilization will then come into the light of day. Once that happens,
the system will not be able to go on. The lie upon which it is built
will be out, and there will be no hiding the truth any longer. We shall
have to face the facts because the facts will be facing us. Unable so
much as to entertain the idea of a limit to material expansion or to
conceive of a social order fundamentally different from our own, the
governing class are nevertheless unconsciously preparing the way for the
new social order by seeking political suicide, which of course is the
only thing they can do considering they cannot go forward and are too
proud to go back. For “pride goeth before a fall.”</p>
<p>Far be it that any words of mine should deter our governing class
from the pursuit of a policy which is so full of beneficent promise for
the future of mankind. My concern is not with them, but with the
Socialist and Labour movements, which I fear may fall into the same pit.
For the situation after the war will be full of dangers for men who have
hitherto based their policy upon the assumption that industrialism has
come to stay. They have assured themselves so often that “we cannot go
back” that they will be entirely helpless when confronted with a
situation through which they cannot go forward. If therefore they are
not to be taken by surprise, if after the war we are not to go to pieces
as Russia did after her revolution, it is urgent that the leaders of the
Socialist and Labour movements should pause and think. If they do not,
then the collapse of the present order will leave society entirely
without leaders, at the mercy of our Jacobins and Bolsheviks, who, like
their predecessors in the French and Russian Revolutions, will make the
anarchy complete by facing every issue as it arises, not with the
understanding which comes from broad and humane sympathies, but in the
narrow and mechanical way which is only possible to minds drilled in the
materialist misinterpretation of history.</p>
<p>That is where I will leave the matter. I have drawn attention to the
danger which threatens us, and I have suggested within certain limits
the direction in which a solution may be found. If you ask for a more
detailed plan I reply that such is undesirable, for a purpose wedded to
details may easily suffer shipwreck. Our need, on the contrary, is an
aim sufficiently noble to unite men coupled with an understanding and
determination to mould circumstances as they arise. A precedent
condition of success upon such lines is a clear and widespread
recognition of the problem confronting us as it actually exists. If this
could be secured half of the battle would be won, and we need have no
fear as to our ability to improvise measures when the crisis comes.
Meanwhile two prejudices stand in the way of such a desideratum. One is
our utterly irrational faith in the stability of industrialism; the
other is an ignorance where it is not a wilful misrepresentation of the
past. Let us not forget that in history, as Mr. Chesterton has reminded
us, there has never been a Revolution which did not in some measure aim
at being a Restoration.</p>

<h1>The Function of the State</h1>
<blockquote>
<p> This is the reason why the law was made, that the wickedness of men
should be restrained through fear of it, and that good men could safely
live amongst bad men; and that bad men should be punished by the law and
should cease to do evil for fear of the punishment.</p>
<p>(From the Feuro Juzzo, a collection of laws Gothic and Roman in
origin, made by the Hispano-Gothic King Chindasvinto, A.D. 640. In the
National Library of Spain, Madrid.)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is typical of the confusion in which a generation of Collectivist
thinking has involved social theory that when to-day men speculate on
the attributes of the State in the society of the future they invariably
proceed upon the assumption that its primary function is that of
organization. The syndicalist, with his firmer grip on reality,
realizing that the State is an extremely bad and incompetent organizer,
rightly comes to the conclusion that if the State can find no better
apology for its existence it is an encumbrance—a conclusion from which I
can see no escape for such as conceive organization to be the primary
function of the State.</p>
<p>National Guildsmen, though accepting the State as essential to a
well-ordered society, have not always been able to escape from this
dilemma. Mr. Hobsondismisses the idea of organization being the primary
function of the State, but conceives of it as spiritual, though the
examples he gives in support of his contention, with the exception of
education, namely, foreign policy, public health and local government,
appear to me to be more mundane than spiritual. This contention,
however, is begging the question. It is not a satisfactory answer to the
Syndicalist. It suggests the existence of activities with which a Guild
Congress may not be qualified to deal, but it offers us no clear
principle for guidance. Mr. Hobson’s understanding of “spiritual” is
different from mine; and I would say that if the State cannot justify
itself as an organizer, it certainly cannot do so as a spiritual
influence. Not only does it not exercise any spiritual influence to-day,
but it is questionable if the State has ever done so in the past. On the
contrary, the State appears to exercise a baneful influence on whatever
spiritual activities it has taken under its protection. Most people
would agree that the influence of the State upon the Anglican Church has
been a most depressing one; while it is significant that in the one
section of this Church which is to-day alive—the High Church—advocates
of disestablishment are to be found. Nobody will be found to defend our
national educational system or to maintain that the participation of the
State in the task of education has in any way fulfilled the expectations
of its promoters. Nor, again, can any one maintain that the patronage of
the arts by the State exhibits any degree of insight or understanding.
It is, I believe, in the nature of things that this should be so, for
the State is of the earth earthy. The problem of temporal power which
engages its attention does not tend to create an atmosphere favourable
to the growth and development of things spiritual.</p>
<p>If, then, the State is not to be justified as an organizer nor can it
exercise spiritual functions, on what grounds is it to be justified? The
experience of history provides the answer. The function of the State is
to give protection to the community—military protection in the first
place, civil protection in the next, and economic protection in the
last. Let me deal with economic protection first; for if I am to be
understood at all it is necessary to make it clear that I refer to
something very different from the Protection of current politics.
Protection is a double-edged sword and may just as easily be a curse as
a blessing. Protection against the economic enemy beyond the seas is the
necessary corollary of any stable economic system. But protection
against the economic enemy at home is the primary necessity, for it
means the protection of the workers against exploitation. It involves a
restoration of the Guilds. By chartering these the State gives economic
protection to the community.</p>
<p>The connection between an economic protection of this order and
military and civil protection may not at first sight be obvious. But a
little thought will perhaps show that they are mutually dependent. All
these forms of protection have this one thing in common—they seek to
guard society against the depredations of the man of prey. Economic
protection or privilege is demanded for the Guild in order to prevent
the man of prey from securing his ends by means of trickery. Civil
protection is demanded in order to prevent the same type of man from
securing his ends by means of personal violence. Military protection is
demanded in order to secure the community against attacks from without,
which is the inevitable consequence of the domination of an adjacent
people by men of this type. From this point of view the differing
psychology of nations is to be explained. The internationalist may be
right in affirming that, taken in the mass, men are very much alike all
over the world. But in practical affairs what makes the difference is
the type of man that dominates a civilization, for the dominating type
gives the tone to a community, and it is that which in politics must be
reckoned with.</p>
<p>The manifest truth of this view of the function of the State has been
obscured by two things: firstly, by the undoubted fact that in our day
the State is very much at the mercy of the man of prey; and secondly, by
the acceptance of reformers of Rousseau’s doctrine of the “natural
perfection of mankind.” The first may or may not be a reason for giving
the existing State an unqualified support, since law is no longer
enacted to enable <em>good men to live among bad</em>, but to enable
<em>rich men to live among poor</em>. The second is a more serious
matter, because it tends to confirm the man of prey in the possession of
the State by standing in the way of the only thing that can finally
dislodge him—the growth of a true social philosophy. It has always been
a mystery to me why Rousseau’s doctrine should have found acceptance
among Socialists. How they reconcile their belief in the natural
perfection of mankind with their violent hatred of capitalists I am
entirely at a loss to understand. If the domination of the modern world
by capitalists is not to be explained on the hypothesis that when the
State withdrew economic protection from its citizens by suppressing the
Guilds the capitalists, by a process of natural selection, came to
dominate the lives of the more scrupulous members of society, then how
is it to be explained? To exonerate capitalists from personal
responsibility by blaming the “system” is pure nonsense, because it
presupposes the existence of a social system independent of the wills of
its individual members, and especially of capitalists who are its
dominating type. Moreover to speak of capitalism as the capitalist
system is itself a misnomer, for it is not in any sense a system. On the
contrary, capitalism is a chaotic and disorderly growth, while every
effort to bring order into it reacts to increase the prevailing
confusion. Socialists are right in hating capitalists; they are wrong in
denying the only rational justification for that hatred—original sin. I
insist upon a frank recognition of this fact because I do not see how
the Guilds are to be restored apart from it. Just in the same way as the
modern Parliamentary system is the political expression of the doctrine
of the natural perfection of mankind, so the Guild system in the Middle
Ages was the political expression of the doctrine of original sin. About
this no two opinions are possible. The Mediaevalists realized that
rogues are born as well as made, and that the only way to prevent the
growth of a cult of roguery such as oppresses the modern world is to
recognize frankly the existence of evil tendencies in men and to
legislate accordingly. It was for this reason that they sought to
suppress profiteering in its various forms of forestalling, regrating
and adulteration; for they realized that rogues are dangerous men, and
that the only way to control them is to suppress them at the start by
insisting that all men who set up in business should conform to a strict
code of morality in their business dealings and daily life. Liberalism,
with its faith in the natural perfection of mankind, was based upon the
opposite assumption—that the best will come to the top if men are left
free to follow their own desires. They sought to inaugurate an
industrial millennium by denying economic protection to the workers,
while they dreamed of a day when military protection would no longer be
necessary. Both of these illusions have been shattered by the war, but
the doctrine upon which they were built—the natural perfection of
mankind—remains to perpetuate our confusion. When it, too, is shattered
we may recover the theory of the State.</p>

<section id="the-class-war" class="level1">
<h1>The Class War</h1>
<section id="i" class="level2">
<h2>I</h2>
<p>There can be little doubt that the struggle which will decide the
form which Socialist thought and action must finally take will be fought
between the Neo-Marxists and Guild Socialists. For though the immediate
practical proposals of the two movements have sufficient in common for
the differences to appear to a Collectivist as the differences between
the moderate and extreme parties into which all movements tend to
divide, yet they are finally separated by principles which are as the
poles asunder, and Socialists must before long choose between them. As
the situation develops they must cleave either to a purely materialist
or to a spiritual conception of the nature of the problem which
confronts us. They cannot remain in their present indeterminate
state.</p>
<p>Though a collision between the two movements is inevitable, so far
nothing more than skirmishes between outposts have taken place. Yet they
are sufficient to indicate upon what lines the attack of the
Neo-Marxists is likely to develop Guild Socialism, it appears, is not
acceptable to men whose central article of faith is the class war Though
Guild Socialism has arisen in opposition to Collectivism, and though, I
believe, when has reached its final form, it will be found to be farther
removed from Collectivism than Neo-Marxism itself, nevertheless, Mr.
Walton Newboldtells us that the Neo-Marxists firmly and honestly believe
it to be a bureaucratic variation of Collectivism intended to perpetuate
the authority of the middle class.</p>
<p>That the Neo-Marxists should have chosen this line of attack is
significant. It testifies to what is uppermost in their minds. For
though in their propaganda they demand social justice for the workers,
it is manifest that class-hatred rather than the desire for justice is
the mainspring of their actions. I hold no brief for the middle class.
It has many and grievous faults, and it pays for them dearly in defeat,
in isolation, in lack of hold upon the modern world. So far from seeking
to save itself in the manner which the Neo-Marxists suspect, it has not
to-day sufficient faith to believe it might be successful if it made the
attempt, and it is increasingly reconciling itself to an idea of Marx
which the Neo-Marxists appear to have forgotten—that the middle class
will become merged in the proletariat. Anyway, on no other hypothesis
except pure idealism can I explain the action of those middle-class
Socialists who have sought to advocate the Guilds. For if they imagine
they are going to save the middle class by the promotion of a system of
democratic organization in every unit of which they would be in a
hopeless minority, then all I can say is that they must be fools of the
first order and are entitled to the contempt with which Mr. Newbold
regards them. Further, if the Neo-Marxist contention is correct they
must explain why the National Guilds League opposed the Whitley Report,
for the middle class has certainly nothing to lose by its adoption.</p>
<p>Facts of this kind are not to be gainsaid. The reason why Guild
Socialists propose to include the salariat in the Guild is a purely
practical one. The simplest way to bring the capitalist system to an end
is for the workers to take over the industries of the country as they
actually exist. This is common sense and nothing more. Modern industry
is a very complex affair, and our daily needs require that the various
people concerned in industry can be persuaded to co-operate together.
But if any radical change is to be brought about, and the spirit of
co-operation maintained, it can only be on the assumption that the
workers are magnanimous when they are victorious. This is the way all
the world’s great conquerors have consolidated their power; and the
workers will never be able to carry through a successful revolution
until they understand it. For magnanimity disarms opposition. But to
preach the class war is to court failure in advance, for it is to seek
the establishment of power, not on a basis of magnanimity, but of
suspicion; and this robs victory of its fruits by rendering politically
impracticable those very measures which, if enacted, would make victory
permanent. In such circumstances, the defeated become desperate, are
afraid to give in, and, seeing no hope for themselves in the new order,
they band themselves together to restore the old. It is thus that
revolution is followed by counter-revolution and the workers are
defeated.</p>
<p>The right method, it seems to me, is not to preach revolution, but to
preach ideas. It is necessary to form in the mind of the people some
conception of what the new social order will be like. When the mind of
the people is saturated with such ideas one of two things must happen
Either the Government must acquiesce in the popular demand, or
revolution will ensue. The former is preferable because, as the change
can then be inaugurated with cool heads, it is more likely to be
permanent. It is no argument against this method to say that the Labour
Party has failed. Firstly, because the Labour Party is an insignificant
minority and therefore cannot exercise power; and, secondly, because the
Labour Party never made up its mind what it really wanted. This latter
reason makes it fairly safe to say that if the Labour Party should get
into power at the next election it would not be able to effect radical
change. In these circumstances our immediate work should not be to bully
the Labour Party, which, in the nature of things, can only reflect
opinion, but so to clarify our ideas that unanimity of opinion will make
its appearance in the Labour movement. The danger is that the people may
succeed to power before ideas are ripe. We might then expect a
succession of violent conflicts proceeding from the attempt to realize
an unrealizable thing. This is what happened in the French Revolution,
when the Jacobins, obsessed with the idea of a democratic centralized
government, refused to tolerate any other organizations within the
State, thus opposing the formation of those very organizations which
render a real democracy possible. The Neo-Marxists by repudiating
State-action altogether seem to Guild Socialists to be falling into an
error the exact opposite to that of the French Revolutionists. Their
society would fall to pieces for lack of a co-ordinating power; if the
present order were thrown over in its entirety, it would be impossible
to improvise arrangements to meet the situation which would be created.
We should be starved at the end of a fortnight.</p>
<p>If starvation has been the fate of Russia, which is an agricultural
country, and where the class war in the main has meant only the
abolition of landlords, how much more will it be the case in a highly
industrialized State like our own which can be maintained only by a very
high degree of co-operation, and where the middle class forms such a
large proportion of the community. If the working class of Russia could
not abolish 2% of the population without precipitating social chaos,
what chance have the working class in this country after abolishing 30%?
On the other hand, if the advice of Guild Socialists is followed and
industries are taken over in the first place as they exist, the complete
democratization of industry could at the most only be a matter of a few
years, for the working class would be in a majority in every Guild.</p>
<p>That a scheme calculated to have such an effect should have
originated among middle-class Socialists only appears incredible to
Mr. Newbold and his friends because they will persist in approaching
every question from the point of view of class. But it is not incredible
when we realize that middle-class Socialists are often as much “fed up”
with the existing system as members of the proletariat, though perhaps
for different reasons. The misunderstanding and Consequent suspicion
which Neo-Marxists have for middle-class Socialists is largely due to
the fact that different motives bring them into the movement. Viewing
everything from a purely economic point of view, the Neo-Marxists are
unable to understand that men may be very dissatisfied with the existing
state of society though they are in fairly comfortable circumstances.
They may dislike the work they are compelled to do, or they may be
interested in the arts, or some other subject, and finding commercialism
opposed to all they want to do, come to hate the system. The more
educated and the more imaginative a man is the more restless he will
become under the present system, because the more he may find himself
balked and thwarted in life. Most men love to do good work, and they
learn to despise a system which compels them to do bad. With the typical
Fabian the motive is apt to be purely philanthropic. It is this that has
led them astray. They came to support bureaucracy because they wanted an
instrument with which to abolish poverty; and in regard to anti-sweating
legislation they have proved to be right. Their mistake was to advocate
as a general principle a form of organization which is only to be
justified under very exceptional circumstances for dealing with
exceptional problems.</p>
<p>The idea that bureaucracy is a method of organization peculiarly
acceptable to the middle class is a romantic illusion which exists
entirely in the Marxist imagination. Some years ago (ten or more) I
attended a meeting of the Fabian Society and heard Mr. Webb, while
protesting against the attitude of certain Fabians who objected to
officials, affirm that under Socialism all men would be officials. The
announcement was received in dead silence as something altogether
incredible. It was clear even then that Fabians did not altogether
relish the idea of society being organized on a bureaucratic basis. Mr.
Webb got his own way, not because the feeling of the meeting was with
him, but because his critics could not at the time offer any
alternative. The triumph of Mr. Webb in the Socialist movement was due
entirely to the fact that he was definite and knew exactly what he
wanted; whereas those who were opposed to him did not, and those who
supported him were entirely unconscious of where his policy was leading.
Many evil things come about this way; there are more fools in the world
than rogues, and, generally speaking, we are much more likely to get at
the truth of things by assuming that most men are fools than by assuming
they are rogues. Let us not forget that the road to hell is often paved
with good intentions. If Marxists would think more of psychology they
would not be so full of suspicions. They would begin to understand that
man is a many-sided and complex creature and is not to be explained
entirely in terms of economics.</p>
<p>Such an understanding would revolutionize their policy. From being
exclusive they would seek to become inclusive. Instead of espousing a
doctrine which sets every man’s hand against his neighbour, they would
seek the creation of a synthesis sufficiently wide to be capable of
welding together different types of men in the effort to establish a new
social order. Their present policy leads nowhere. Neo-Marxists may begin
by repudiating middle-class Socialists as men whose interests are
opposed to those of the working class. But if I am not mistaken, it will
not end there. Before long they will be required to repudiate the
parasitic proletariat as dependents of the rich; after which they will
have to repudiate skilled workers as members of a privileged class.
Where will working-class solidarity be then? Nowhere, I imagine; for the
working class will be a house divided against itself. I say it will be.
Truth to tell, it already is.</p>

<h2>II</h2>
<p>While the Guild movement acknowledges a different starting-point from
that of the Neo-Marxists, it moves towards a different goal. That goal
is symbolized in the word “Guild.” I wonder how many Neo-Marxists have
ever pondered over the significance of that word. For it is a symbol of
the past a past to which many Guildsmen hope to return. It was not idly
chosen. The right to use it had to be fought for. It could not have been
used by the National Guild movement had not the formulation of its
policy been preceded by a movement or agitation which for a generation
sought to remove prejudices against an institution in the past which an
ever-increasing number of men to-day are coming to recognize as the
normal form of social organization. This battle was fought out among our
much-despised intellectuals—by historians, craftsmen, architects and
others, who realized that the prejudice which had been created by
interested persons in the past against Mediaeval institutions had become
a peril to society. Leading men to look with suspicion upon all normal
social arrangements, it tended to thwart all efforts to reconstruct
society on a democratic basis by diverting the energies of the people
into false channels. How much of the discord and ill-feeling which
prevails between the different sections of the reform movement had its
origin in prejudice against the past it is impossible to say; but it is
a certainty that Collectivism as a theory of social salvation could only
have been formulated by men whose minds had been formed on a false
reading of history. And as the gospel of the class war owes its present
popularity to the disappointment which followed attempts to reduce
Collectivism to practice, the popular misconceptions of history are to
be held responsible for much.</p>
<p>That the Neo-Marxists should consider the Guild movement to be merely
a variation of Collectivism shows how completely they misunderstand not
only the underlying purpose of the movement, but its history too. For
not only are the principles of Collectivism and Guilds fundamentally
opposed, inasmuch as the method of the former is control from without by
the consumer, while the method of the latter is control from within by
the producer, but Guildsmen were accustomed to attack Collectivism long
before Marxists came to suspect it. But it was not until Socialists were
disillusioned over Collectivism that Guildsmen could get a popular
hearing. When in February 1906 my <em>Restoration of the Guild
System</em>, which contained a destructive analysis of Collectivism,
appeared, it was held up to ridicule by the Socialist and Labour
Press.And now at last, when the current of opinion has turned in our
favour, Mr. Newbold tells us that the Neo-Marxists regard the Guild
movement as a variation of bureaucratic Collectivism. This opinion they
arrive at, not from any careful economic analysis such as we have a
right to expect from men who profess economic infallibility, but
because, knowing something about psychology, which they do not, we
refuse to join them in the class war; just as if the only differences
which could possibly divide vSocialists were differences of policy and
that differences of principle were matters of no importance. Twelve
years ago they wanted to rend us because we were not Collectivists;
to-day, because they imagine we are.</p>
<p>The fundamental differences of principle which separate Guildsmen
from Collectivists and Neo-Marxists alike will become more pronounced as
the Guild scheme unfolds. The <em>New Age</em> has said that National
Guilds “is rather the first than the last word in national industrial
organization.” It is in this light that the present proposals of the
movement should be regarded. If a fuller programme has not hitherto been
put forward it is not because Guildsmen will be satisfied with the
present minimum, but because a general agreement has not yet been
reached with respect to the more ultimate issues. Guildsmen have been
forewarned by the fate of Collectivists from advancing a wide and
comprehensive programme which has not been properly thought out, since
only disaster can follow such a course. All the same, some unanimity of
opinion is coming into existence in regard to wider issues, and as,
generally speaking, it is in the direction I should like to see things
go, I will venture my opinion for what it is worth as to our ultimate
destination.</p>
<p>As I interpret the Guild movement, it is the first sign of a change
in thought which will seek to I solve the social problem, not by a
further development along present lines, which can only lead us to fresh
disasters, but by effecting a return to the civilization of the Middle
Ages. I do not mean by this that we shall in the future recover every
feature of that era or that many things which exist to-day will not be
retained in the future. I mean that in the first place we shall resume
in general terms the Mediaeval point of view and that this will involve
a return to Mediaeval ideas of organization. My reasons for believing
this are that I think we are moving into an economic cul-de-sac from
which the only escape is backwards; and that if the interests of life
are to take precedence of the interests of capital we are inevitably
driven into a position which approximates to that of the Mediaeval
economists. The whole trend of economic development from Renaissance
times onward, which has led to the enthronement of capitalism, has been
to reverse the Mediaeval order.</p>
<p>In believing thus that capitalism will reach a climax in its
development beyond which it can proceed no farther, I am at one with
Marx in his interpretation of the evolution of capitalism. It seems to
me that Marx predicted very accurately the trend of capitalist
development. He foresaw that industry would tend to get into fewer and
fewer hands, but it cannot be claimed that the deductions he made from
this forecast are proving to be correct, for he did not foresee this
war.Not having foreseen this war, Marx did not foresee the anti-climax
in which the present system seems destined to end. And this is fatal to
his whole social theory, because it brings into the light of day a
weakness which runs through all that he says—his inability to understand
the psychological factor, and hence to make allowances for it in his
calculations. Marx saw the material forces at work in society up to a
certain point very clearly and from this point of view he is worthy of
study. But he never understood that this was only one half of the
problem and finally the less important half. Although Marx clearly
foresaw the trend of economic development, he did not see that it had
been accompanied by a loss of spirituality, and that simultaneously with
the concentration of attention upon material things, religion and art
had lost their hold over men. From this historical consideration it may
be affirmed that the spirit of avarice grows in inverse ratio to the
interest anc activity in religion and art. And as both of these
activities were undermined by the changed outlook towards life and the
forces set in motion by the Renaissance, the spirit of avarice became
triumphant. In the same way that an epidemic to which healthy people are
immune tends to spread rapidly among people of a low physical vitality,
so avarice claims its victims among people to-day because, owing to the
separation of religion and art from life, the mass of the people live in
a state of low spiritual vitality.</p>
<p>An understanding of what I may call “the spiritual interpretation of
history” will bring us nearer to an understanding of the Guild movement.
It has been well described as a religion, an art and a philosophy, with
economic feet. That is really what it is. For its aim is nothing less
than to restore that unity to life which the Renaissance destroyed.
Recognizing that every social system is but the reflection of certain
ways of thinking certain ideas of life it seeks to change society by
changing the substance of thought and life. But, unlike other movements
which have aimed at spiritual regeneration, it deems it advisable to
begin at the economic end of the problem in the belief that it is only
by and through attacking material and concrete evils that a spiritual
awakening is possible. For to quote the words of Mr. de Maeztu”men
cannot unite immediately among one another; they unite in things, in
common values, in the pursuit of common ends.”</p>
<p>We can agree with the Neo-Marxists in recognizing that under the
existing economic system the interests of capital and labour are
irreconcilably opposed, and that no compromise is possible. Where we
differ from them is in respect of issues about which we are not prepared
to compromise. They envisage the problem primarily in the terms of
persons and as a warfare between the classes We, on the contrary, see
this conflict of interests as the inevitable accompaniment of a
materialist ideal of life which rejects religion and art with their
sweetening and humanizing influence. Tracing the existence of the
problem to a different origin, we naturally seek for it a different
solution. We meet the Marxist affirmation that the problem is material
by affirming that it is both spiritual and material. And we part company
by reminding them that “man does not live by bread alone.”</p>
<p>Finally, I would plead for a more generous attitude of mind among the
various sections of the Socialist movement. If the existing economic
system based upon competition is to be replaced by one based upon
co-operation, the communal spirit must be substituted for the present
individualist one. But the no-compromise policy of the Neo-Marxists
tends to postpone the arrival of that spirit indefinitely by sowing the
seeds of discord and suspicion everywhere. All movements rest upon trust
and confidence, and these are impossible apart from a certain charity of
spirit which will make some allowance for human weakness and mistaken
judgments. For all men at times are apt to err. Would it not be wiser,
therefore, instead of always accusing others of interested motives, to
try first to understand them—to see whether difficulties are not to be
explained on other grounds? If Neo-Marxists refuse such counsel and
still maintain that their suspicions are justified and that only
self-interests prevail, then in the name of logic I do not see how even
they can claim to be an exception to this rule. What guarantee have we
that they, like others, are not on the make? How are we to know that
they are not seeking the support of the working classes for their own
selfish ends? I do not say that this is so. What I do say is that it is
the logical deduction from their position. And it is a deduction from
the consequences of which they may not be able finally to escape. For
if, by some chance, power should pass into their hands, they will be
expected to live up to their promises. When they are in difficult
circumstances, as all men in power find themselves at times, and have to
choose between two evils, they must not be surprised if those whom they
have had no option but to disappoint apply the same standards to
themselves. It will be no use for them to plead extenuating
circumstances, for extenuating circumstances are no part of the
Neo-Marxist philosophy. And they must not expect more generosity from
their supporters than they have extended to others. Out of fear of them
they will be driven from one act of desperation to another, until
finally they bring into existence a circle of enemies sufficiently
strong to encompass their downfall. And their enemies will show them no
mercy. Such was the fate of the uncompromising Jacobins of the French
Revolution, and if I am not mistaken it will be the fate of Lenin and
Trotsky to-morrow It is the fate of all political extremists who seek to
establish power on a basis of suspicion.</p>

<h2>III</h2>
<p>Though the criticisms which Mr. Newbold has made against middle-class
Socialists can be easily refuted, it is possible they have not been
finally disposed of, inasmuch as the differences are much more
fundamental than a mere misunderstanding. As always happens in respect
of issues of a fundamental nature, people find it extremely difficult to
say exactly what they mean, and it may be that the Neo-Marxists in their
relations with the middle-class Socialists feel an instinctive antipathy
which so far they have been unable to define.</p>
<p>Whatever may be the explanation of the antipathy shown by
Mr. Newbold, I can scarcely think he really means what he says when he
questions the right of middle-class Socialists to take part in Labour
activities; for on that basis not only would he, as a middle-class
person, be excluded, but it may be said that nearly all Socialist
literature has been written and all the pioneer work has been done by
middle-class persons, so that but for their assistance the Socialist
movement would never have come into existence. I conclude, therefore,
that he must mean something else.</p>
<p>It has been suggested that the secret of the trouble may be that
Labour has “come of age,” and in consequence the advice of middle-class
Socialists is resented much in the same way that a son is apt to resent
the advice of a father who fails to realize that his son has grown up.
The father’s advice may be right, but it is necessary for the son to act
on his own initiative in order that he may feel his feet in the
world.</p>
<p>Though this is an explanation of the estrangement, it does not
satisfy me. I can scarcely think that the Labour movement is so
short-sighted as to resent advice given by those outside of its class if
it found such advice really helpful. The trouble is, I think, that until
quite recently, when the Guild propaganda began to make headway, the
intellectual leadership of the Socialist movement was entirely in the
hands of the Fabians, and I fear they have queered the pitch for us. For
their sympathies were not really democratic. It was poverty rather than
wage-slavery they were anxious to abolish, and so, instead of seeking to
interpret the subconscious instincts of the workers and to direct them
into their proper channels, they sought to impose an economic system
upon them which left human nature entirely out of account. As might have
been expected, human nature has rebelled. The workers, having thrown
over Collectivism, are trying to grope their way towards a solution of
their problems. Left to their own resources, the workers have
undoubtedly seized upon an important truth—that any solution of the
economic problem must come as the result of a struggle—a truth that
Guildsmen alone among intellectuals have recognized. Meanwhile, the
repudiation by Labour of its leaders is not to be interpreted as a
denial of the necessity for leadership, but rather as a protest against
leaders who cannot lead, because their eyes are turned in the wrong
direction.</p>
<p>Looking at the situation from this point of view, our immediate need
is to define our position in regard to industrialism in terms that admit
of no ambiguity. As a means towards this end it is imperative that we
should in the first place not only look round and take stock of the
situation which is developing, but anticipate within certain limits the
situation which will have to be faced after the war. In this connection
everything points to the coming of a great struggle between Capital and
Labour. At the moment Labour has Capital at a disadvantage. But after
the war Capital intends to get even again. According to all reports
capitalists are everywhere sharpening their knives, determined, if they
must die, that they will die fighting. Though I doubt not that in the
long run Labour will be triumphant, I am by no means sure that victory
will follow the first encounter—unless the Army makes common cause with
Labour when it returns from France, which is not at all unlikely when we
consider the bitter resentment which has been caused by the utterly
inadequate pay and separation allowances. But in any case the outlook is
not immediately very promising whichever side wins. If Capital is
victorious we shall be committed to an industrial policy which can only
eventuate in further wars; for a state of things in which war is an
ever-present contingency must be the inevitable consequence of the
insane policy of for ever seeking to effect an increase in the volume of
production, remembering that markets were already filled to overflowing
before the war. On the other hand, if Labour wins, the immediate
prospects are no more reassuring. There is a danger that in such an
event we may pass through all the phases common to social revolutions
ere sanity will prevail.</p>
<p>I say there is this danger. I do not, however, think it is
inevitable. Whether or no we pass through all these phases depends upon
the extent to which we can intelligently anticipate possible happenings
in the future and can guard ourselves against pitfalls. This task should
not be impossible, considering that we have the experiences of the
Russian Revolution to draw upon. In our anticipated revolution, as in
the Russian, the moderate party will come first. For we may be assured
that whenever the Labour Party arrives with a majority in the House of
Commons it will be composed of moderate men. It is the very moderation
of the Labour Party that will be its undoing, for it will be unable to
act decisively in any direction. This is easily understood when we
remember that its members are held together by no common bond of
principle. It is only necessary to read the reports of the Labour
conferences to realize that the Labour Party does not know where it
stands. Though Collectivism as a social theory is entirely discredited,
the Labour Party is still vaguely Collectivist in one direction, while
in the other its members are simple trade unionists with no general
social theory—vaguely Liberal if they are anything at all.</p>
<p>Naturally it will be impossible for such a heterogeneous body to act
with any unanimity and decision. It will be the old story over again.
Just as after 1906, when the workers were dis appointed with the doings
of the Labour Party they turned against it in violent disgust and
inaugurated an internecine warfare which continued almost until the
outbreak of war, so it may be expected that a similar disgust will
follow the establishment of a Labour Government. For it will dilly-dally
with things, and all its actions will be feeble. Then the great crisis
will arrive, and our future history will depend entirely on the way it
is met. Once confidence is destroyed in moderate men, there is a danger
of things rushing to the opposite extreme. The Neo-Marxists (our
Bolsheviks) will get their chance. They will point to the impotence of
the Labour Party, accuse its leaders of lack of courage and a desire to
make terms with the enemy and conspire to seize power and inaugurate the
class war. If they succeed we shall go the way Russia has gone—to
anarchy. But there is no reason why they should succeed. It will be our
fault if they do. The situation could be steadied by a vigorous
propaganda which would change the basis of the struggle from a warfare
about persons to a warfare about ideas or things. Let me explain.</p>
<p>It is apparent, when we think about it, that the anticipated failure
of a Labour Government could be accounted for in one of two ways. It
could be ascribed to the corruption and moral cowardice of its members,
or it could be attributed to lack of ideas—the absence of a social
theory adequate to the situation which confronted them. The
Neo-Marxists, envisaging the problem primarily in the terms of persons
as a warfare between classes, would doubtless seize upon the personal
aspect of the failure. Guildsmen, I hope, would be more generous in
their criticisms. They should not accuse the Labour men of being knaves
when they are transparently as innocent as fools. For who but fools
would imagine it possible to find a solution to a political and economic
problem the like of which has never been seen in history merely by means
of a parliamentary majority united not by the possession of common
principles but only in common aspirations? Who but fools could imagine
that a majority so constituted could stand for one moment the shock of
actuality? Realizing that the failure of a Labour Government may safely
be predicted from its entire absence of social principles, Guildsmen
should take every opportunity of driving this point home, insisting that
goodwill is no substitute for ideas. They should, moreover, be careful
to point out that Neo-Marxists differ from the Labour Party only to the
extent of substituting ill will for good will inasmuch as the Labour
Party and the Neo-Marxists have alike occupied their minds entirely with
the problem of how power may be won to the utter neglect of the problem
how it may be retained and used.</p>
<p>Not only are the Neo-Marxists without any social theory in the sense
that they have never applied themselves to the task of elaborating the
principles upon which a democratic and communal society must rest, but
they appear to be unaware that one is necessary. All they see is that
power to-day is in the hands of capitalists, and they want to see it
transferred into those of the workers. That is very good so far as it
goes. But it is insufficient for the purpose of reconstructing society,
which they would be called upon to do if ever they succeeded to power;
because if industry suddenly changed hands and the salariat were
banished, as they propose, everything would not go on sweetly as before.
The centre of gravity of industry would have completely changed. This
change would introduce a host of problems that would demand immediate
solution. It is vain to suppose that without clearly defined principles
to guide them men unaccustomed to power would prove equal to the task.
They would be like amateurs in possession of a powerful and unfamiliar
weapon which, mishandled, would be much more likely to destroy them than
the enemy.</p>
<p>As herculean a task as the solution of the economic problem is for
any Government, its difficulties will be increased a thousandfold for
the Neo-Marxists if ever they get into power; for their class-war policy
carried into execution will complicate the economic problem by a
psychological one of equal magnitude which, like the Bolsheviks, they
will have no idea how to meet except by force. Now force in the hands of
materialists always produces the very opposite effect to that which is
intended, for materialists never understand psychology. But I fear it is
useless to reason with Neo-Marxists about such things. They will never
know anything about these problems until they are up against them, when
they will be the most surprised people in the world.</p>
<p>Recognizing, then, the danger which would follow the success of the
Neo-Marxists in such a crisis, Guildsmen should, by an intelligent
anticipation of events, take measures to protect their flank. They
should inaugurate a vigorous propaganda against the impossibilism of the
Neo-Marxists. If in such an effort they are to succeed, it is essential
before all things that the good faith of the Neo-Marxists be taken for
granted, and that Guildsmen should seek to discredit them by carrying
NeoMarxist ideas to their logical conclusion, showing how their excess
of zeal must defeat their own ends by provoking reaction, since the mass
of the people will become so weary of the anarchy which must follow the
inauguration of the class war, that they will come to welcome a return
of the old regime merely for the sake of peace and quietness. It should
not be difficult to drive these truths home considering that both the
Russian and the French Revolutions provide abundant illustrations of how
class warfare fails to achieve its ends.</p>
<p>Further, Guildsmen must show the Neo-Marxists that their ideas are
not only subversive of others but of themselves. Neo-Marxists are very
fond of insisting “that the method prevailing in any society of
producing the material livelihood determines the social, political and
intellectual life of men in general,” but it never apparently occurs to
them to make the deduction that in that case they and their gospel also
become a part of the disease of society—a deduction which is not only
evidenced by the fact that the Neo-Marxist gospel finds its warmest
supports in those districts where industrialism is most highly
developed, but that Neo-Marxists are so much a part of the system as to
be incapable of imagining any other. They do not propose to change the
system, but only its ownership.</p>
<p>From this point of view, it could easily be shown that in comparison
with Guildsmen the Neo-Marxists are merely Conservatives; for Guildsmen
have not only questioned industrialism, they have some idea of what to
put in its place. They realize that as its retention must involve
society in successive wars they must destroy it, or it will destroy
them. It is the clear recognition of this fact that inclines an ever
increasing number of Guildsmen to look back to the Middle Ages for
inspiration and guidance. They do this not as romanticists but in
soberness and truth.</p>
