<h1>Preface</h1>
<p>In a series of articles recently contributed to the <em>Daily
News</em> under the title “Europe in Chaos,” the writer deduced the doom
of modern civilization from the general tendency of the ratio of
exchange to fall since the Armistice. In his last article he suggested
that “Perhaps the Guild Socialists have seen a vision of the ultimate
solution,” and then went on to say, “but if so they must descend from
the clouds and begin to construct their system here and now.” For “if
things are allowed to drift for another two or three years it will be
too late.”</p>
<p>This little book accepts the general point of view of European
affairs as enunciated in those articles and seeks to carry the
discussion one stage nearer to practical politics. If Guild Socialists
are not to be seen everywhere at work constructing their system, it is
not due to the absence of any will or desire in the matter but to the
fact that except in respect of Building Guilds they have no clear notion
of how exactly to get to work. We believe we know the ultimate solution;
but hitherto it has not been quite clear to us what is the next step.
The recent divisions among Guild Socialists witness only too clearly to
the perplexity that has overtaken the movement. It occurred to me whilst
reading the articles already mentioned, that perhaps this perplexity was
due to the fact that the Guild theory and policy was inadequate to the
extent that it had been built up around the problem of production to the
neglect of the problem of exchange. It was inevitable perhaps that this
should be so, since we were led in the first instance to believe in the
essential Tightness of Guild organization from a study of the problems
of production rather than of exchange. Moreover, the particular form
that Guild theory has taken is in no small measure due to the fact that
it arose to combat the bureaucratic tendencies of Collectivism. In this
light the defect of the Guild theory is not that what it affirms is not
true, but that other aspects of truth have escaped its attention.</p>
<p>The present volume aims at remedying this defect by stating Guild
theory and policy from the point of view of exchange. In so far as it
differs from the previous Guild theory it is a difference of emphasis.
Instead of making the establishment of Guilds the central issue, it
treats Guilds as a means to an end the end being the maintenance of the
Just Price—in the belief that the establishment of the Just Price is the
solution of the problem of exchange in so far as this problem is a
question of money, and values. It moreover shows that as far as England
is concerned, the revival of agriculture is the necessary corollary of
any stabilization of the exchanges. By thus widening the issues it
becomes possible to carry the Guild idea into spheres where hitherto it
has not entered.</p>
<p>Mention has been made of the articles entitled “Europe in Chaos.” By
the kind permission of their author, Mr. J. S. M. Ward, and the Editor
of the <em>Daily News</em>, I am able to include them in this volume as
an Appendix. The articles are the summary of Mr. Ward’s book, since
published, entitled <em>Can our Industrial System Survive?</em> (W.
Rider &amp; Sons, Ltd., 2s. 6d.). It is a book I cannot speak too highly
of, for if facts and figures could awaken us to the realities of the
situation that confronts us it should do so, while it is entirely
indispensable to any one who is anxious to understand the problem.</p>
<p>It remains for me to thank Dr. P. B. Ballard for his assistance in
preparing the MS. for press.</p>

<section id="the-need-of-a-social-theory" class="level1">
<h1>The Need of a Social Theory</h1>
<p>Whatever differences of opinion may exist as to the best way of
facing the problem confronting society, a general consensus is growing
up that the present order is doomed. It is agreed that things are going
from bad to worse, and that it is only a matter of time—a few years at
the most—before the great crisis will arrive that will determine whether
England is to go the way of Russia and Central Europe—to anarchy and
barbarism—or to be reconstructed on some co-operative or communal
basis.</p>
<p>Which of these two ways things will go depends upon our action in the
immediate future. If we allow ourselves to drift, then in a few years’
time we shall arrive at the state of affairs we know by the name of
Bolshevism. For “Bolshevism is the last resort of desperate starving
men”;and starvation is at the end of our story, as we shall begin to
understand more clearly when the reasons for the present impasse are
understood. From this fate there is no possible means of escape, except
by boldly facing the problem that confronts us and resolutely taking in
hand the reconstruction of society from its very foundations upwards.
Nothing less than that is any use at all. For it is the foundations that
are giving way. And so, unless we act while yet there is time, there can
be no saving of our civilization.</p>
<p>Meanwhile the difficulty that confronts reformers and statesmen alike
is to know how to act. All their lives they have lived on certain
phrases and shibboleths, and in a very literal sense taken no thought of
the morrow. They have talked about progress and emancipation and our
glorious civilization, which, in spite of defects, they have never
failed to remind us is superior to any civilization of the past. And now
Nemesis is overtaking us. A few years of war and our glorious
civilization is seen to be crumbling and our statesmen and reformers are
entirely at a loss to explain how such a thing could possibly happen,
for they lack any comprehension of the problem of our society as a
whole. They have for so long been concerned with the secondary things in
society and have so persistently neglected the discussion of primary and
fundamental principles, that they are without the mental equipment which
a great crisis demands.</p>
<p>Evidence of their lack of grip on reality is forthcoming on every
hand. Men who know what they want go straight ahead. They act with
promptitude and decision. But in these days, if one were to judge only
by appearance, one would say that the great idea in politics is to wait
until you are pushed, and then to yield with a becoming dignity. But of
course that is only appearance. The real explanation is that our
statesmen and politicians have lost their way, and they are without a
compass to guide them. In other words they have become opportunists
because they have lost their faith, and they have lost their faith
because the social theories upon which they relied have become
untenable. Before the war the gospel of economic individualism that had
been the faith of the nineteenth century was already discredited, while
collectivism, which sought to take its place, was proving unworkable in
practice. But the war has completed the destruction of these beliefs,
and in consequence their adherents flounder about, attempting first this
and then that in the hope that by some unexpected turn of events a path
will be open to them. But it all avails nothing. For without a belief
they lack conviction; and this prevents them from acting with unity of
purpose or continuity of effort in any direction. Among the thousand and
one things that claim their immediate attention they are unable to
distinguish those which are of primary and fundamental importance from
those that are secondary. So when by chance they stumble upon something
which if persisted in would give results, they lack the determination to
go forward, and the moment they come up against some obstacle they turn
round and run. So it will be until we can establish a social theory that
will give such an explanation of the facts as will guide them. For there
is no such thing as a purely practical problem, inasmuch as behind every
practical question is to be found a theoretical one.</p>
<p>Now the underlying cause of the collapse since the war of all social
and economic theories that had secured any widespread organized support
is that one and all of them took our industrial system for granted as a
thing of permanence and stability. This is just as true of Socialist as
of capitalist economics, inasmuch as all Socialist theories presupposed
that a time would come when the workers would be able to take over
capitalist industry as a going concern. The consequence is that
Socialist and Labour leaders are as much perplexed as capitalists
themselves at the sight of the system crumbling to pieces. The
possibility of this dissolution had never occurred to them, and they
have no idea how to stop it. And this is no wonder. For their belief in
the permanence of industrial organization was so absolute that it led
them to reject all ideas that were incompatible with the industrial
system; and as all ideas of a fundamental nature inevitably came into
collision with the industrial system it meant in practice that they
refused to recognize any fundamental ideas whatsoever, so they are
consequently left stranded without an idea that has any relevance to the
present situation. The Bolsheviks alone are not disillusioned; and they
are not disillusioned because in spite of their economic formulae their
faith is in the class war. So firm are they in their belief that things
will naturally right themselves once the workers attain to power, that
they actually discourage speculation regarding the future as something
that diverts energy from their central object of attaining power.</p>
<p>Recognizing, then, that the collapse of existing economic theories is
due to the fact that they accepted industrialism as a thing of
permanence and stability, it follows that any new social theory adequate
to the situation must be based upon principles that are antipathetic to
industrialism. Such principles are, I believe, to be deduced from the
informal philosophy of the Socialist movement which is to be
distinguished from its formal and official theories. The formal theories
of Socialism based upon the permanence of industrialism are now happily
discredited for ever. But the informal philosophy of the movement stands
unimpaired, for it is based upon something far more fundamental than any
economic theory—the permanent needs of human nature. On its negative
side it is a moral revolt against capitalism; on the positive side it
rests upon the affirmation of the principles of brotherhood, mutual aid,
fellowship, the common life. These are the things that the Socialist
movement finally stands for; and they grow by reaction. In proportion as
existing society becomes more hopeless, more corrupt, more unstable, men
will tend to take refuge in idealism; and this idealism the informal
philosophy of the Socialist philosophy supplies. Such people have
hitherto accepted the economic theories of Socialism as convenient
formulae to give shape to their moral protests. But intellectual
comprehension among them was rare, inasmuch as most of them swallowed
the theories without tasting them. When they do taste them, they spew
them out.</p>
<p>The deduction to be made from all this is that Socialism is finally a
moral rather than an economic movement. It is because of this that it
has gathered strength in spite of the discrediting of its successive
theories. It is this that we must build upon. Our aim should be to bring
economic theory into a direct relationship with this informal moral
philosophy, to dig as it were a channel in which its whole strength may
flow instead of being wasted in the sands of contradictory beliefs and
impossible doctrines.</p>
</section>
<section id="on-wages-and-foreign-trade" class="level1">
<h1>On Wages and Foreign Trade</h1>
<p>In the preceding chapter I urged the necessity of a social theory
that would bring economics into a direct relationship with the informal
Socialist philosophy with its ideas of brotherhood, mutual aid,
fellowship and the common life. Recent events have brought into a new
prominence the antagonism that exists between the head and the heart of
Socialism.</p>
<p>During the war wages were raised to keep pace with the increasing
cost of living. Nowadays, when prices are falling, the demand is made by
employers that a corresponding reduction shall be made in wages. Behind
this demand is the contention of employers that foreign trade cannot be
restored and unemployment lessened while costs of production in this
country remain as high as at present. The more reasonable trade
unionists are disposed to accept this view on the assumption that the
employers are willing to accept a corresponding reduction in profits.
But the extremists refuse to accept any lowering of existing standards
of wages without a struggle.</p>
<p>Now, from the point of view of formal Socialist theory, the
extremists who refuse to consider a reduction in wages are in the right.
If the relations of Capital and Labour are the mechanical ones
postulated of Socialist theory the workers are justified in demanding
that they shall enjoy a permanent increase in wages. Nor can there be
any doubt whatsoever that they are ultimately in the right. If it was
possible in the fifteenth century for the town worker to be paid a wage
that worked out six or seven times the cost of his board and the
agricultural worker two-thirds of this amount,it is on the face of
things extraordinary that with our enormously increased productivity it
should yet be impossible to pay the workers a wage which covers little
more than bare necessities. Yet a close examination reveals the fact
that the present system of industry is so wasteful and built up on a
basis so false that it cannot be made to pay the wages that the workers
are theoretically justified in demanding. It is apparent that the
increases cannot come in the particular way Labour expects or by their
particular methods. It is not in the nature of things. Industry as it
exists to-day in our great industrial centres is dependent upon foreign
trade, and so long as it is so dependent it will be necessary to
compete. Except, therefore, where we enjoy some monopoly or other
artificial advantage, we shall only be able to compete successfully by
producing as cheaply as possible, and that involves lower wages than
were paid during the war. There is no getting away from this. If we are
to remain an industrial competing nation, the workers must be prepared
to accept such wages as will enable our manufacturers to compete
successfully.If they are not satisfied with so little—and there is no
reason why they should be—the present system must be changed.</p>
<p>It is here we come to the popular Socialist fallacy. The present
system is not changed merely by changing its ownership, since if the
workers succeeded in getting possession of industry to-morrow they would
be subject to the same economic laws to which employers are subject
to-day, and they would be compelled to act much in the same way because
they would be required to run the same machine. But if we wish to change
the system we must recognize the necessity for industry to become as far
as possible independent of foreign markets. This involves the revival of
agriculture, for only by such means can the home markets be restored. In
so far as industry could depend upon the home markets, we should be able
to exercise control over the conditions of industry, and real
fundamental changes in the position of the workers could be introduced.
But it is vain to suppose that any such change can be introduced so long
as industry rests on the economic quicksand of foreign markets. It
becomes apparent therefore that if the position of the workers is to be
improved they must take longer views. There is no such thing as
“Socialism now.” But there is such a thing as Socialism in ten years’
time if the workers could be persuaded to follow a consistent policy
over such a period of time. The trouble is that the workers, as indeed
most people in every class, think of the social problem in the terms of
their own jobs. The engineer wants a solution in the terms of
engineering; the bootmaker in the terms of boots; the clerk in the terms
of clerking. It is natural, perhaps, but none the less impossible, for
it disregards the action of those world-wide economic forces which
dominate all nations in proportion as they become dependent upon foreign
trade.</p>
<p>I said that if the position of the workers is to be improved they
must take longer views. It is clear that modern industrial activities
are essentially transitory in their nature. Quite apart from the war, it
is manifest that sooner or later the situation that exists to-day must
have arisen, for the existing arrangement whereby goods are produced at
one end of the earth and food at the other does not possess within
itself the elements of permanence. It owes its existence to many things,
but by far the most important to the fact that we were the first to
employ machinery in production. This virtual monopoly that we had for so
long encouraged the growth of cross-distribution. But it is uneconomic
and therefore cannot last, for it is apparent that other things being
equal, it must be cheaper to produce goods near the markets than at a
distance from them. An arrangement may be uneconomic, but custom and
inertia will combine to perpetuate it long after the circumstances which
brought it into existence have disappeared. The war woke up many of our
former customers to this fact. Before the war they were content to
produce food and raw materials, and relied upon us in the main for their
manufactured goods. During the war we could not supply their wants, and
they took to manufacturing all kinds of things for themselves. As these
manufactures are carried on near to where the raw materials are found or
produced, it is manifest that we cannot hope to recover these markets.
They must gradually slip from our hands. We cannot expect to export in
the future such large quantities of manufactured goods to Australia,
Canada, South America and elsewhere as hitherto. Meanwhile, in order to
finance the war, we disposed of most of our foreign investments. The
result of it all is that our industries will be unable to provide work
for such numbers as hitherto. Not being able to sell goods to the
food-producing nations, we shall soon be without the money to pay for
the food we must import to keep our population alive—a fact that is
brought home to us by the constant falling of the rate of exchange.</p>
<p>It appears therefore that though the reversal of our Russian policy,
the complete removal of blockades and the provision of credits for the
restoration of European trade would relieve the unemployed problem, it
cannot hope to solve it, since a wider view of the situation leads to
the conclusion that such relief can only be temporary. The renewal of
trade facilities with Russia and Central Europe might relieve the
congested state of the home market, but it will not provide us with the
wherewithal to buy food, because Europe has no food to give us in
exchange for our goods. If food is to be obtained, we must give
something in exchange to the countries which produce it or we must
produce it for ourselves. And as those countries upon which we have been
accustomed to rely for a supply of food are beginning to produce their
industrial wares for themselves, it follows that the only way to meet
the situation is to take measures to produce as much food as possible
for ourselves by the revival of agriculture. By no other means can the
balance of exchange be restored. Agriculture is fundamental, since the
price of food determines the cost of everything else. If therefore we
neglect to revive agriculture, we shall be exploited by the countries
who do produce food, and this, by raising the price of our manufactures,
will in turn increase our difficulties in competing in other markets. It
is insufficiently recognized that during the war the agricultural
populations all over the world have been becoming rich while the
industrial ones have become poor. It is not improbable therefore that
capitalism, declining in the towns, may rehabilitate itself through
agriculture. It certainly will do so unless Socialists are very much
more wide awake than they have hitherto been.</p>
<p>Though at the moment the change which we are required to make will be
difficult and inconvenient to the people affected, it will, if taken in
hand with resolution, prove undoubtedly to be a blessing, for our
society is top heavy, and the revival of agriculture is a movement in
the direction of a return to the normal. But even with agriculture
revived it is questionable whether we shall in the long run be able to
support our present population. In so far as this is true, there is only
one remedy, and that is emigration. And here the real trouble begins.
Emigration has so often been advocated as an excuse for postponing
reforms at home that a natural and justifiable suspicion attaches to any
one who advocates it, as Mr. Lloyd George found out recently when he
suggested it as a remedy for unemployment. But it was not only with
critics at home that he had to contend. The Dominions themselves lost no
time in announcing that they had unemployed problems of their own and
therefore could not assume responsibility for ours. And there the matter
was allowed to drop. Nevertheless I am persuaded that emigration is a
necessary part of the solution of our problem, and by one means or
another it must be rendered practicable. That England, having sold her
foreign investments and lost her oversea markets, cannot hope even with
agriculture revived to support her present population is demonstrable
beyond doubt. But that our Dominions, with their vast empty spaces of
fertile land that can produce the food and supply the raw materials of
industry, cannot find room for our surplus population is a paradox a
paradox moreover that needs to be explained, since it is impossible to
deny that such is the situation in our colonies to-day. It suggests the
question: Why does our economic system produce such contradictory
results? What is it that has got such a strangle-hold upon all modern
industrial nations?</p>
</section>
<section id="the-tyranny-of-big-business" class="level1">
<h1>The Tyranny of Big Business</h1>
<p>I concluded the last chapter by asking what it was in the economic
system of industrial nations that had got such a strangle-hold upon
them.</p>
<p>The usual answer is of course to ascribe the general paralysis to the
economic reactions that followed the war. In the immediate sense this is
partially true. But of itself it is an insufficient explanation, for it
is evident that the disease existed and was rapidly developing before
the war. Let us therefore begin our inquiry by focusing our attention
upon a most evident symptom and consider the widespread tyranny of big
business. The success of these large organizations has been so dazzling
that they have almost succeeded in silencing critics as to the ultimate
validity of their activities. They have claimed to be the last word in
efficiency, and to be justified as evidence of the survival of the
fittest. For most people this has been a sufficient apology, and they
have inquired no further. But we are unwilling to accept them at their
own valuation, since we are persuaded that in them and their methods the
immediate cause of the paralysis that is overtaking industry is to be
discovered.</p>
<p>It will not be denied that expansion is to our industrial system the
breath of life. So long as the system could continue expanding, it
worked in spite of its shortcomings and injustices. But our economic
system is so fearfully and wonderfully made that it cannot remain
stationary. Once the limit of expansion is reached, contraction sets in,
and with it all manner of internal complications begin to make their
appearance. The honour of placing a limit to this process of expansion
belongs to large financial and industrial organizations which have
overreached themselves. So keen have they been on making money that they
have ignored all other considerations, and for a generation they have
been at work undermining the very foundations on which their prosperity
ultimately rested. The changed position of the pioneer since big
business got under way will bring this point home. The pioneer is the
advance guard of civilization. He goes out into uninhabited places, he
clears the land, and it is by means of his conquests that the area of
civilization is extended. That he should continue his work is necessary
for the continuance of our civilization; for, as I have already said,
expansion is to it the breath of life. And how has big business treated
the pioneer? The answer is, it has simply strangled him. The pioneer is
isolated. He is dependent upon dealers for his supplies and for the
marketing of his produce. In the old days of colonial expansion there
were many such competing dealers, and this fact ensured him favourable
terms; but a time came when big business got the upper hand. And then
tilings changed. The pioneer found himself at the mercy of some trust or
syndicate that was in a position to bleed him white and did not hesitate
to do so. When news was noised abroad of the treatment to which those
who went on the land in the colonies were subjected, no new men
ventured. They no longer went forth with the proverbial half a crown in
their pockets to embark upon some new enterprise with a feeling of
assurance and confidence. For they began to realize that they had not a
dog’s chance of success. It was thus that the initiative and enterprise
that made our colonies was strangled. The age of expansion came to an
end and our colonies began to develop their own unemployed problems.
That is why nowadays they have no place for the emigrant. Contraction
has set in.</p>
<p>A generation ago it was the custom to belaud these large
organizations; to assume that because they were successful they
represented a higher form of industrial organization; and, on the
grounds of the necessities of social evolution, to condone the
immorality of their methods as inevitable in a time of transition. It
was supposed that by suppressing competition they were laying the
foundations of the communal civilization of the future, and that when
their great work of amalgamation and centralization was completed they
would pass into the hands of the people. To-day we realize that this was
a vain delusion. We no longer justify them as the fittest to survive. We
have begun to ask the question as to whether they can survive at all.
For they have been too short-sighted to make any provision for the
future. Systems of organizations that have endured in the past were
always careful to see that a ladder existed whereby the coming
generation could rise step by step until they reached the summit of
their callings. By such means these organizations renewed themselves.
With such an eye to the future the Mediaeval Guilds jealously guarded
the position of the apprentice. Apprenticeship was “an integral element
in the constitution of the craft guilds, because in no other way was it
possible to ensure the permanency of practice and continuity of
tradition whereby alone the regulations of the guilds for honourable
dealing and sound workmanship could be carried on from generation to
generation.”And this principle was not only understood by the craftsmen,
but it was understood by the merchants in the past who, we read, were
accustomed to sneer at the East India Company because it could not
“breed up” merchants of initiative and independence. And this feeling
against joint-stock enterprises continued until the middle of last
century, when it yielded at last to the force of circumstances
consequent upon the industrial revolution, and the principle of limited
liability became admitted in law.</p>
<p>The evil inherent in joint-stock companies was not fatal to them at
first, since before the acknowledgment of the principle of limited
liability in law they were few and far between, and so it became
possible for them to renew their organization, wherever it was
defective, by recruiting from outside their ranks. But once they become
general, the evil inherent in them rapidly developed; for it soon became
apparent that the divorce of ownership from management upon which they
were based brought into existence horizontal and class divisions between
those in their employ; and this spread disaffection everywhere. For men
began to find that their future depended less on themselves than on the
attitude of their immediate superiors towards them. In the higher ranks,
these circumstances led to those jealousies and feuds by which all large
organizations are distracted. In the lower ones it led to apathy and
indifference; for when large organizations took away liberty from the
individual they took away from him all living interest in his work. The
effect of it all has been the destruction of the sense of
responsibility. This results in a loss of efficiency. Expenses go up and
up, and there seems to be no stopping them. Recourse is had to
amalgamations. But it is all of no avail; for the soul has gone out of
the body and there is no restoring it.</p>
<p>There is no restoring the <em>morale</em> of these large
organizations, because they have succeeded in destroying confidence and
goodwill everywhere by the short-sightedness of their policy. For not
only are limited companies responsible for the flood of commercial
dishonesty and legalized fraud that have simply overwhelmed modern
society, but under their aegis Labour has become more and more
embittered. It is widely recognized nowadays that the mass of men have
no disposition to do any more work than they can help. This is in the
main due to these large organizations which lead men to feel that not
they but others are going to profit by their labour. So long as
competence was rewarded and honour appreciated there was an incentive
for men to work. If they became efficient they might get on to their own
feet, and the presence of a number of men with such ambitions in
industry gave a certain moral tone to it that reacted upon others. But
when, owing to the spread of limited companies, all such hopes were
definitely removed; when technical ability, however great, went
unrecognized and unrewarded, and proficiency in any department of
industry incurred the jealousy of “duds” in high places, demoralization
set in. All the old incentives were gone, and no one was left to set a
standard. The suppressed impulses of men whose ambitions were thwarted
turned into destructive channels. The rising generation, feeling
themselves the defenceless victims of exploitation, are in open
rebellion. They refuse any longer to make profits for others, and this
refusal is accompanied by a spirit that is anything but conciliatory.
There is, I am persuaded, a close connection between the spread of
Bolshevism and the exploitation of the young. The hopeless position in
which they find themselves, without prospects of any kind, is largely
responsible for their uncompromising temper and a certain impatience and
ruthlessness that disregards circumstances. It is insufficiently
recognized that Bolshevism here is in no small degree a rising of the
younger generation against the old. Can we wonder?</p>
<p>While on the one hand big business finds itself threatened by the
disaffection of the workers, on the other it is perplexed by the
contradictions of its own finance. The faith of financiers has hitherto
been placed in reducing the costs of production. It was assumed that any
reduction of costs would be automatically followed by an increase of
demand. But is this so? Such a policy is no doubt a sound business
proposition from the point of view of the individual capitalist who is
anxious to find ways and means of increasing his market. But it has
obvious limitations when applied generally. To the individual capitalist
bent on increasing his market it matters nothing how the costs of
production are reduced. But when generally applied it makes all the
difference in the world whether such reductions are effected by improved
methods of production or by lowering wages. For the latter method, by
reducing purchasing power, undermines demand. We see therefore that
demand does not depend ultimately upon a reduction of costs, but on the
distribution of wealth. In so far therefore as big business sets about
to centralize wealth it undermines demand. But again, in so far as
increased production is necessary to maintain its financial stability,
there is necessitated an increased demand. We see then that to seek to
centralize wealth and to increase production is to travel in opposite
directions at the same time; for while centralization of wealth tends to
undermine demand, increased production presupposes increased demand. Can
we wonder that a deadlock has overtaken industry? The immediate cause
may be the war, but it is clear that the problem is far more
fundamental, and that the deadlock would have arrived quite apart from
the war. Like political despots our commercial magnates are beginning to
find that the successes of despotism exhaust its resources and mortgage
its future.</p>
</section>
<section id="on-investing-and-spending" class="level1">
<h1>On Investing and Spending</h1>
<p>Considering the anti-climax in which big business is seen to be
ending, the question arises: What is it that has impelled it on such a
fatal course?</p>
<p>With the individuals immediately concerned, love of money, power and
personal ambition has doubtless been the mainspring of their activity.
But it is a mistake to attribute too much to purely personal influences,
inasmuch as such men are the instruments rather than the cause of
developments. Their freedom of choice can be exercised only within
certain well-defined limits. Those limits are determined by the current
ideas and practice of finance, to which all their activities must have
reference. To understand therefore the cause of the deadlock that is
overtaking industry, we must inquire into those principles of finance
which are accepted by all who engage in commercial activities.</p>
<p>In this connection it may be held that there is a sense in which it
is true to say that the City has been the victim of a false economic
philosophy. For though the principles of that philosophy have on the
whole followed and justified economic practice rather than directed it,
yet there can be little doubt that commercial men would not have
embarked upon their latter-day enterprises with such abandon and
self-confidence had they not believed that they were supported by the
thought of the age. And indeed, apart from Ruskin and his followers, who
were comparatively few in number, the thought of the age did on the
whole, until a few years before the war, support the City in its doings.
Collectivists objected to the proceeds of industry going into the
pockets of a few, but they accepted the principles governing City
finance. They did not perceive that apart from the way the earnings of
industry were distributed there was anything fundamentally wrong in
these principles of finance. Yet that there must be something very
fundamentally wrong needs no demonstration to-day. Big business is too
manifestly breaking down to be able to justify itself any longer.</p>
<p>Ultimately of course what is wrong is the modern philosophy of life,
with its worship of wealth—its belief that the acquisition of money
precedes the attainment of all other good things in this universe. But
to change these values (and they must be changed) is the work of time,
and we are unfortunately faced with immediate issues, the legacy of
generations of false philosophy. To deal with them it is necessary to
know the proximate cause of things, and the proximate cause of the
activities of big business is undoubtedly the theory of investments as
popularly understood. That theory teaches that money is never so
usefully employed as when it is invested in some productive enterprise,
and it recognize no limit to the possibility of such investments. Nearly
all people with money accept this theory as a truth that is axiomatic,
and consider themselves as doing a positive service to the community
when they reinvest any spare money they may have for further increase
instead of spending it in some way or other. For, as they are accustomed
to say, money so invested provides employment.</p>
<p>This is the philosophy of the rich to-day. If we went back a couple
of generations to the old Tory school we should find that they believed
it was not the investing but the spending of money that gave employment.
Though neither of these conflicting philosophies is ultimately true, the
old Tory idea is infinitely nearer the truth than the current one; while
as a practical working philosophy for the rich there is simply no
comparison between the two. For whereas money spent does return into
general circulation, the effect of investing and reinvesting surplus
money is in the long run to withdraw it from circulation, much in the
same way as if it were hoarded. Nay, it is actually worse than if it
were hoarded. Hoarded money may undermine demand, but it does not
increase supply, whereas when reinvestment proceeds beyond a certain
point it increases supply and undermines demand at the same time.</p>
<p>It is apparent that in a society in which economic conditions were
stable a balance between demand and supply would be maintained. The
money made by trade would be spent, and in this way it would return into
general circulation. Thus a reciprocal relationship would be maintained
between demand and supply. In former times money was spent upon such
things as architecture, the patronage of arts and letters, the endowment
of religion, education, charitable institutions, and such-like ways.
Expenditure upon such things stimulated demand and created employment,
while it tended to bridge the gulf between rich and poor. The only
defence that is ever made for the existence of a wealthy class in
society is that but for their expenditure in such ways our great
monuments of architecture, educational and other endowments would never
have come into existence. I am not quite sure how far this is true. But
it is manifest that when the rich did dispose of their wealth in such
public ways they were in a position that could be defended on the
grounds of expediency if not of equity. But what defence can be put up
for the rich to-day who have so completely lost all idea of function as
to be unwilling to spend at all except upon themselves; who fail to
support charitable institutions; who are so inaccessible to culture as
to neglect the patronage of arts and letters; who so lack confidence in
their own judgment as to be unable to patronize the crafts of to-day and
take refuge in antiques; who are unwilling to spend money upon
architecture, nay, who can only be persuaded to buy pictures when
assured they are good investments—in a word, who have no idea what to do
with their surplus wealth except to reinvest it for further increase,
that is to use it for the purpose of undermining the economic system
that permits them to live such useless existences. But perhaps they know
best!</p>
<p>This is no exaggeration. The misuse of surplus wealth by the rich
upsets the balance between demand and supply. And this is productive of
waste. For when more money is invested in any industry than is required
for its proper conduct, the pressure of competition is increased; for
any increase in the pressure of competition means that money that should
be spent is invested to increase supply; and this increases the selling
costs by encouraging the growth of the number of middlemen who levy toll
upon industry, while it increases the expenditure on advertisements and
other overhead charges. Thus we see it transfers labour from useful to
useless work. Further, it encourages the over-capitalization of industry
by burdening industry with a dead load of watered capital. These things
react to raise the price of commodities on the one hand and to
demoralize production on the other. For in the effort to produce
dividends on this watered capital all moral scruples are thrown
overboard. Thus we see there is a direct connection between the
perpetual reinvestment of surplus money for further increase and the
unscrupulous methods of big business. Once an industry has experienced a
boom on the Stock Exchange, its doom is sealed. It becomes grossly
over-capitalized, and every kind of dirty trick and smart practice is
resorted to in the attempt to produce dividends on the watered capital.
Attempts are invariably made to squeeze more out of labour. The
disaffection of labour to-day is in no small measure the reaction
against this kind of thing.</p>
<p>In former times the rich appeared to have some notion that there was
such a thing as a limit to the possibilities of compound interest. But
after the introduction of machinery the possibilities of making money
increased so enormously as to remove from their minds any sense of
limitations. In demanding that all money shall bear compound interest,
finance is committed to an absolutely impossible principle; as must be
apparent to any one who reflects on the famous arithmetical calculation
that a halfpenny put out to 5%, compound interest on the first day of
the Christian era would by now amount to more money than the earth could
contain. This calculation clearly demonstrates that there is such a
thing as a limit to the possibilities of compound interest; yet what we
call “sound finance” to-day proceeds upon the assumption that there is
no limit. In consequence, it invests and reinvests surplus wealth and
loads industry with a burden it cannot bear. For if wages were reduced
to the lowest figure capable of keeping body and soul together and
prices raised to the highest limit, productive industry could not be
made to yield the returns which the conventional system of invested
funds now requires. Can we wonder that capitalism is breaking down?</p>
</section>
<section id="on-producing-more-and-consuming-less" class="level1">
<h1>On Producing More and Consuming Less</h1>
<p>The development of foreign trade was a primary cause in leading the
rich to abandon their habit of spending their surplus wealth in public
ways and to invest and reinvest it for the purpose of further increase.
The discovery of America and the sea route to India transferred
prosperity from the Hanseatic and other inland towns to seaports and
countries with a good seaboard. The change was very profitable to
English merchants, who began to secure a larger share of the commerce of
the world. Moreover, it stimulated British industries, and the rich
began to find increasing opportunities for profitable investment.</p>
<p>These changes were accompanied by certain changes in economic
thought. In the seventeenth century there arose the Mercantile school of
economists whose central idea was to increase the wealth of the nation
by foreign trade; and as a means towards this end they taught that the
rule to follow was “to sell more to strangers yearly than we consume of
theirs in value.” Translated into the terms of industry this doctrine
becomes that of “producing more and consuming less.” By following this
advice, money was made, and in the terms of cash men became wealthy. But
unfortunately this was not the only consequence, for this policy brought
into existence the problem of surplus production. This surplus was in
the first instance deliberately created in order to take advantage of
the opportunities of making money that the exploitation of distant
markets afforded. But after machinery was invented, it became the plague
of our society, for surplus goods increased so enormously in volume that
it became a matter of life and death with us to find markets in which to
dispose of our goods. For, as a consequence of this money-making policy
our society has become economically so constituted that we cannot live
merely by producing what we need, but must produce all manner of
unnecessary things in order that we may have the money to buy the
necessary things, of which we produce too little.</p>
<p>But the evil does not end with ourselves. In the long run, this
policy defeats its own ends. It is obviously impossible as a world
policy because all the nations cannot be increasing their production and
decreasing their consumption at the same time. The thing is simply
impossible. Hence it came about that once the employment of machinery
began to give us an unfair advantage in exchange, one nation after
another was drawn into the whirlpool of industrial production. And in
proportion as this came about we were driven further and further afield
in the search for markets, until a day came at last when there were no
new markets left to exploit. When that point was reached competition
became fiercer and fiercer, until the breaking-point arrived and war was
precipitated.</p>
<p>The crisis came in Germany. Immediately it is to be traced to the
Balkan War, which closed the Balkan markets to her, and to the fact that
after the Agadir crisis in 1911 the French capitalists withdrew their
loans from Germany, and these things combined to bring the German
financial system into a state of bankruptcy; for this system, built upon
an inverted pyramid of credit, could not for long bear the strain of
adverse conditions. But the ultimate reason why the crisis made its
appearance first in Germany was undoubtedly due to the fact that more
than any other nation she had forced the pace of competition. In the
fifteen years before the war Germany had quadrupled her output. The rate
of productivity, due to never-slackening energy, technique and
scientific development, was far out-stripping the rate of demand, and
there was no stopping, for production was no longer controlled by demand
but by plant. In consequence, a day came when all the world that would
take German-made goods was choked to the lips. Economic difficulties
appeared, and then the Prussian doctrine of force spread with alarming
rapidity. War was decided upon for the purpose of relieving the pressure
of competition by forcing goods upon other markets, and to cheapen
production by getting control of additional sources of raw material.
Hence the demand for colonial expansion, the destruction of the towns
and industries of Belgium and Northern France, and the wholesale
destruction of shipping by the submarine campaign. They all had one
object in view: to relieve the pressure of competition and to get more
elbow-room for German industries. The idea of relieving the pressure of
competition by such commercial sabotage was not a new one. It had been
employed by Rome when she destroyed Carthage and Corinth and the
vineyards and olive groves in Gaul out of commercial rivalry. The
Germans, who copied the methods of the Romans in so many ways, followed
them also here.</p>
<p>Had Germany succeeded in bringing the war to an early conclusion, it
is possible that this policy would have been successful to the extent of
giving her industries a temporary relief from the pressure of
competition. But instead of being terminated in a few months as she had
intended, the war dragged on for over four years, and this exhausted the
economic resources of Europe. When the Armistice was signed there was a
world shortage of the necessaries of life and it became necessary, if
Europe was not to disintegrate economically, that efforts should be made
to resume at once normal trade relationships. But unfortunately the Big
Four into whose hands arrangements for Peace had fallen, were not, as
Mr. Keynes has told us, interested in economics. What they were
interested in was military guarantees against a renewal of hostilities,
territorial questions and indemnities. And so it came about that the
realities of the economic situation, the urgency of which permitted no
delay, were entirely disregarded. For while on the one hand the Peace
terms ignored the fact that the war had left many in a state of economic
exhaustion, and that therefore she could only pay indemnities on the
assumption that she experienced a trade revival; on the other hand the
huge figures at which the indemnities were fixed, and the continuance of
the blockade, by interfering with the operations of normal economic
forces, precluded the possibility of any such revival.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, unmindful that the war had been precipitated by the fact
that the industrial system had reached its maximum of expansion, the
doctrine was preached in this country that salvation was to be found in
a policy of maximum production. That the world shortage of the
necessaries of life demanded that efforts should be made to make good
the deficiency, no one will be found to deny, for in many directions
making good the deficiency was a race against time. But the advocates of
a policy of maximum production were as little concerned as the Peace
Conference with the realities of the economic situation. They were not
interested in the increased production of food, or finally in any other
form of necessary production, but in finding ways and means of repaying
the War Loan without resort to a capital levy. And this is where they
went astray. For not only was Labour alienated inasmuch as it saw in
this policy an attempt to shift the burden of war taxation on to the
shoulders of the producers, but it led its advocates to demand the
increased production of everything and anything regardless of the fact
that the policy of the Peace Conference both in regard to Russia and to
Central Europe was to close their markets to us, and that during the war
other nations deprived of their accustomed supplies from us had taken to
manufacturing for themselves. The result has been what various writers
on economics foresaw—that indiscriminate production was followed by a
glut, and the unemployed are on our streets.</p>
<p>To add to the public bewilderment, the cry has gone up of late that
the needs of national economy demand that we consume less; and the
average man is a little concerned to know what is meant when he is urged
to produce more and to consume less. The answer is that, absurd and
contradictory as it sounds, it is nevertheless the principle upon which
our glorious civilization has been built. It is a principle with four
hundred years of history to support it, but at last the limits of
industrial expansion necessary to its continuance have been reached.
For, as I have said before, our economic system must either be expanding
or contracting. And as it so happens that as the age of expansion has
come to an end, the age of contraction naturally follows. The
Government, impervious to arguments, has at length had to yield to the
force of facts. It has ceased to admonish all and sundry to increase
their production, and the word has gone round to reduce production and
ration employment, and for each man to work fewer hour; for the opinion
in the commercial world to-day is that less production rather than more
is the remedy for our present difficulties.</p>
<p>Though there may probably be temporary revivals of trade, the process
of contraction now definitely inaugurated will, I am persuaded,
continue. For just as hitherto the normal trend of affairs was, in spite
of recurring depressions, from expansion to expansion, so now when the
tide has turned the normal trend will be from contraction to contraction
a tendency that can only be checked by a complete change in the spirit
and conduct of industry such as is involved in return to fundamentals.
This truth is vaguely apprehended to-day, though at the moment men are
at a loss to know how to translate it into the terms of actuality. But
now when disillusionment has overtaken society there is a prospect that
right reasoning may prevail and a path be found. Let us try to discover
it.</p>
</section>
<section id="fixed-prices-versus-speculation" class="level1">
<h1>Fixed Prices versus Speculation</h1>
<p>We have seen that the existing system of industry and finance is
rapidly reaching a deadlock. What is to be done in the
circumstances?</p>
<p>The first thing to do is to effect such repairs of the old machine as
will enable it to run a little longer in order to gain time to build the
new one, which we must have in running order before the existing machine
breaks down completely. For such a purpose such measures as the reversal
of our Russian policy, the removal of all blockades, and the provision
of credits for the renewal of trade with Central Europe are
indispensable. It will be unnecessary for me to do more than mention
them, as steps towards their fulfilment have already been taken. But it
is necessary to insist that though these measures may bring relief by
enabling our merchants to dispose of their surplus stocks, yet the
relief would only be temporary, inasmuch as if the Continental nations
get on their feet again they will begin to compete with us in other
markets. If on the contrary they do not recover their industrial
position but relapse into more primitive conditions, they will not have
sufficient surplus to enable them to buy our manufactures. If these
facts were clearly recognized and the necessary measures taken in hand,
then we should have nothing to fear. But the danger is that the moment
any improvement in trade is felt we shall stop thinking and pursue the
silly old game, comforting ourselves with the illusion that the
dislocation of trade was due entirely to the war, and that there is
nothing organically wrong with the industrial system.</p>
<p>The truth, however, must be faced. We are in an economic cul-de-sac,
and there is but one path of escape; and that is to get back somehow to
the primary realities of life. It must be recognized that we are up
against the consequences of centuries of injustice, usury, and
Machiavellianism in politics and business, and that there is finally no
escape except to return to the principles of justice, honesty and fair
dealing, upon which all civilizations rest.</p>
<p>Reduced to its simplest terms, the change necessary to enable society
to escape from the deadlock that is threatening industry is conveniently
expressed in the well-known formula:–“the substitution of production for
profit by production for use”; and the first step in that direction will
be taken when we begin to establish a system of fixed prices throughout
industry. For though the Just Price rather than the fixed price is the
ideal to be attained, yet it can only be realized by stages. The fixed
price therefore is to be regarded as a step towards the Just Price,
because the people will never be satisfied with a fixed price that is
not a Just Price.</p>
<p>The difference between a fixed price and the Just Price almost
explains itself. Fixed prices are those that are uniform and are not
determined by competition; but such prices may be anything but just, as
many fixed prices during the war were anything but just. A Just Price
would bear a certain definite relationship to the cost of production,
measured in labour units. It would mean that some things would be sold
for more and other things for less than at present. In the case of a few
useful and necessary things it might mean that they would be sold for
more than at present, because useful labour is invariably underpaid;
while it so happens that they are often sold by retail dealers with
little or no profit in order to attract customers, and provide
opportunities for selling other goods, generally useless and unnecessary
things, that carry a handsome profit. It will be necessary therefore, if
production for profit is to give way to production for use, to readjust
all such selling prices so that the price in each case may correspond to
the actual cost of production, since until prices are so adjusted no
change in the motive of industry is possible. For with prices determined
by competition the producer must think primarily in the terms of profits
if he is to remain solvent.</p>
<p>In all kinds of ways the present system of prices is demoralizing.
Some years ago when I had some experience of the furniture trade, I made
the interesting discovery that it stereotyped the forms of design. It
came about this way. Profits were put on certain things and not on
others. Certain things in general demand, such as chests of drawers,
bureaus, chairs and small tables were sold without profit, while other
things such as dining tables, bookcases, sideboards, heavy curtains and
carpets carried good profits. Simpler kinds of furniture were sold at
cost price and sham ornamental pieces at exorbitant ones. A designer
therefore, in the employ of the furnishing houses, could only exercise
his fancy within certain narrow limits. The furniture had to be
elaborate, and the curtains had to be heavy or there would be no
profits. He might know that some other arrangement would be infinitely
more effective, but he was not allowed to carry it out, for in that case
the public would not be prepared to pay a price that would give a
working profit, though to provide such a profit it might only cost half
of what the sham elaborate design cost. The public would not think they
were getting value for money, and therefore would refuse to buy. This
illustration may serve to show how unjust prices strangle creative work.
They have strangled the effort to revive design and handicraft; for when
conditions obtain which will not allow men to do things in the way they
know they should be done, they lose interest in their work and begin to
think only of profits.</p>
<p>No doubt many who have had experience of other trades could add their
testimony of the peculiar effect unjust prices have had. But in general
it may be said that the effect of unjust prices is to transfer labour
from useful to useless work, with its corollary that useful work is
nearly always badly paid. The result is that men insensibly learn that
it is easier and more honourable to live by exploiting labour for profit
or by trafficking or by money-lending, or by speculating, or by some
parasitic art—by any means in fact except by doing work which is useful
and desirable for the purposes of human life. It is thus that
occupations have come to be esteemed in proportion as they win money,
afford comfort and leisure, and confer individual power and distinction.
The effect of it all is to produce social demoralization. It exalts
false social values; this in turns corrupts everything else, for it
encourages lying and fraud of every kind, and ends by creating an
atmosphere of social lies so dense that few people know where they are.
Divorced from all useful work they have no final test of truth. In
consequence they become dissatisfied, they are at the mercy of every
fashion of opinion, and finally like the builders of Babel they end in a
confusion of tongues, no man being able to make himself intelligible to
any one else.</p>
<p>Thus we see that unfixed and unjust prices divert energy from
production to speculation. It will remain impossible for people to be
interested in the ultimate social utility of anything they do so long as
the price they are to get for their labour is settled by competition.
The reason why the commercial motive is for the most part absent among
professional men is precisely because the price of their services is
fixed; and it will tend to disappear from industry once prices are
fixed. The professional man is able to put his best into his work
because he has not to worry about how much he has to receive for his
services, and it will be the same in industry when the same conditions
obtain.</p>
<p>Uncertainty as to price dislocates industry in every direction, and
has handed production over to the speculator with consequences that are
grossly demoralizing. It is only possible for a man to plan ahead if he
knows where he stands. The farmer, for instance, must plan four years
ahead. He must arrange for a rotation of crops. If he knows he can
dispose of his produce at a certain definite fixed price he can
concentrate all his attention upon getting the best out of his land. He
can go ahead. But if uncertainty as to price surrounds him on every side
he will not produce on such a large scale, for he will need to keep a
greater reserve of capital in case of need. Moreover he will have to be
for ever thinking about prices, of when and where to sell, and this will
prevent him from making the best use of his land. There is no greater
illusion than to suppose that the motive of profit stimulates
efficiency. Only love of work can do that, and nothing detracts from
love of work so much as economic uncertainty. I am convinced that the
decline of quality in production is due far less to avarice than to the
demoralization that accompanies such uncertainty.</p>
<p>Further, the determination of prices by competition leads inevitably
to injustice. In the event of a shortage the producer exploits the
consumer; in the event of a surplus the consumer exploits the producer.
The producer may be ruined as English farmers were in the years 1879-90.
This ruin has reacted to make living increasingly expensive for
everybody. It is thus that unfixed prices leads to unrest among the
workers by introducing an element of uncertainty into the real value of
wages. It leads moreover to disaffection all round. The consumer is
indignant when he is exploited by the producer, and the producer when
ruined becomes a centre of discontent. On the other hand the producer
who has profited by the system hardens his heart towards the rest of the
community because he believes that they would have done the same as he
has done if they had had the chance. He therefore resents criticism as a
personal injustice. It is thus that competition in prices ends in the
promotion of class hatred—of enmity between the haves and the
have-nots.</p>
<p>Then again unfixed prices lead to economic instability. Before the
war, because we were living upon the moral capital of centuries of
tradition and stability, the danger inherent in allowing prices to be
determined by competition was apparent only to a few, though as a matter
of fact economic conditions every year became more unstable. But during
the war, when restraining influences were removed, profiteering became
rampant and what hitherto had only been apparent to a few was seen by
the many. It was seen that no society could endure that allowed prices
to be fixed in this way, inasmuch as it could only end by shaking to
pieces the economic system itself. Hence it was that, faced with this
peril, the Government sought to limit by means of fixed prices the
profits that could be made by any manufacturer or middleman. After the
war, the Government brought in the Profiteering Act to enable it to
continue to exercise the power of fixing maximum prices of articles in
general use, which fixing had during the war been done under D.O.R.A.
Its operation, however, was limited to six months, and since its
expiration there has been a return to the system of competitive prices
for such articles, and prices have begun to fall. Some of the controls,
however, that deal with the price of food and raw material still remain.
They exist independently of this Act.</p>
<p>It can occasion no surprise that measures that interfered so much
with the ways of business should be unpopular in the commercial world.
The business man has the conviction that what is in his personal
interest is necessarily in the interests of the community, since as
society lives by commerce he assumes that anything that interferes with
the liberty of commerce can be in the interests of nobody. Moreover, to
him speculation is the soul of business, and as any extension of fixed
prices over industry would put an end to speculation he can see nothing
but demoralization overtaking the world when business loses its soul. No
doubt he is perfectly honest in believing this. To men who accept
business operations at their face value there is no other conclusion.
The question to us, however, is whether the world does not want another
soul quite different from the one that business affords; whether, if the
moral tone of industry is ever to be raised, business as we understand
it must not go, nay, whether business itself can carry on much longer at
all on its present basis.</p>
<p>But it was not only business men who objected. Socialists and Labour
men also objected. But their objection was of a different order, and was
due to the fact that, having <em>a priori</em> ideas in their minds as
to the way the millennium is to be ushered in, they look with suspicion
upon any idea that has not hitherto found a place in their programme. To
them the fixation of prices was nothing more than a means of satisfying
popular clamour and postponing the day of substantial reform, and for
this reason they never seriously considered it. Perhaps they may, when
they awaken to the fact that it is an idea with potentialities in it
little suspected by its promoters.</p>
<p>But there are other and more valid objections to the Government’s
policy of fixed prices. Their enforcement was accompanied by vexatious
and irritating interferences of all kinds. With this objection I can
entirely sympathize. But I would point out that it does not invalidate
the principle of fixed prices. What it does invalidate is the instrument
that was used for enforcing them. That instrument was the bureaucratic
machine—the system of control from without. It is clumsy and irritating,
but the Government had no option but to use it, for the Guild the system
of control from within—was non-existent. And the Guild, as we shall see
later, is the only instrument that can fix prices properly.</p>
<p>Then there is the objection that certain things went off the market
as soon as prices were fixed. This again does not invalidate the
principle of fixed prices. What it does do is to demonstrate the
impossibility of enforcing fixed prices against the will of a trade.
Here again the solution is to be found in the institution of Guilds. For
a Guild would contain everybody who worked in a trade, not the few
people who were in a position to exploit it, and if everybody in a trade
had a voice in the matter we may be assured that they would act
democratically for the good of all, and not merely in the interests of a
few.</p>
<p>Finally there is the objection of the man-in-the-street, to whom
fixed prices were popular during the war when they prevented prices
going higher, but who turned against them when the control prevented
them falling to a lower level. This objection again is valid. But it
does not invalidate the principle of fixed prices. What it does
invalidate is the fixed price that is not a Just Price; and as the fixed
prices during the war were not Just Prices, it was desirable that
control should be removed to enable prices to return to the normal.</p>
</section>
<section id="guilds-and-the-just-price" class="level1">
<h1>Guilds and the Just Price</h1>
<p>I concluded the last chapter by pointing out that the
man-in-the-street does not object to the principle of a fixed price but
to the fixed price that is not a Just Price. As it happens that the Just
Price was the central economic idea of the Middle Ages, let us pause to
consider what it meant in those days.</p>
<p>The Just Price in the Middle Ages was primarily a moral idea. By that
I mean that it owed its establishment to moral rather than to economic
considerations. It was the idea that between two persons bent on honest
and straightforward dealing it is possible to arrive at something that
may be regarded as a Just Price. Indeed, as a matter of fact, when this
idea pervades the whole community, as it did at one time in the Middle
Ages, conditions are created that make it a comparatively easy matter to
translate such a principle into practice; for under such circumstances
prices remain more or less stationary, and every article acquires a
traditional price. As a moral precept, the idea of the Just Price was
maintained by the Church and supported by the words of the Gospel,
“Whatsoever that men should do unto you, do ye also unto them.” To buy a
thing for less or sell a thing for more than its real value was
considered in itself unallowable and unjust, and therefore sinful,
though exceptional circumstances might sometimes make it permissible.
The institution of buying and selling wares, it was held, was introduced
for the common advantage, and this common advantage could only be
maintained if there was equal advantage to both parties. Such equality
was defeated if the price which one of the parties received was more or
less than the article sold was worth.</p>
<p>Under the auspices of the Guilds, the Just Price became a fixed
price. Indeed it is true to say that the Guilds were organized to
maintain the Just Price. For it is only by relating the Guild
regulations to this central idea that they become intelligible. To
maintain the Just and Fixed Price, the Guilds had to be privileged
bodies having an entire monopoly of their respective trades over the
area of a particular town or city; for it was only by the possession of
a monopoly that a fixed price could be maintained, as society found to
its cost when the Guilds lost their monopolies. Only through the
exercise of authority over its individual members could the Guild
prevent profiteering in its forms of forestalling, regrating, engrossing
and adulteration. Trade abuses of this kind were ruthlessly suppressed
in the Middle Ages. For the first offence a member was fined; the most
severe penalty was expulsion from the Guild, which meant that a man lost
the privilege of following his trade in his native city.</p>
<p>But a Just and Fixed Price cannot be maintained by moral action
alone. If prices are to be fixed throughout industry, it can only be
done on the assumption that a standard of quality can be upheld. As a
standard of quality cannot finally be defined in the terms of law, it is
necessary for the maintenance of a standard, to place authority in the
hands of craft-masters a consensus of whose opinion constitutes the
final court of appeal. In order to ensure a supply of masters it is
necessary to train apprentices, to regulate the size of the workshop,
the hours of labour, the volume of production, and so forth; for only
when attention is given to such matters are workshop conditions created
that are favourable to the production of masters. Thus we see that all
the regulations—as indeed the whole hierarchy of the Guild—arise out of
the primary object of maintaining the Just Price.</p>
<p>The Just and Fixed Price when maintained by the Guilds left no room
for the growth of capitalism by the manipulation of exchange currency,
for it demanded that money should be restricted to its legitimate use as
a medium of exchange. Unconsciously, the Mediaeval Guilds stumbled upon
the solution of the problem of currency which had perplexed the
lawgivers of Greece and Rome and broke up their civilizations, as in
these days it is breaking up ours. The idea is a simple one—so simple in
fact that one wonders how ever it came to be overlooked. Currency, or in
other words money, is a medium of exchange. The problem is how to
restrict it to its legitimate use. So long as it is fairly and
honourably used to give value for value; so long in fact as money is
used merely as a token for the exchange of goods, then a society will
remain economically stable and healthy. But unfortunately such a
desideratum does not follow naturally from the unrestricted freedom of
exchange, that is by allowing prices to be determined by the higgling of
the market; because under such circumstances there is no equality of
bargaining power. The merchants and middlemen, because they specialize
in market conditions, find themselves in a position to exploit the
community by speculating in values. Standing between producers and
consumers, they are in a position to levy tribute from each of them. By
refusing to buy they can compel producers to sell things to them at less
than their real value; while by refusing to sell they can compel
consumers to buy things from them at more than their real value; and by
pocketing the difference they become rich. The principle remains the
same when the merchant becomes a manufacturer, the only difference being
that the exploitation becomes then more direct. For whereas as merchant
he exploits the producer indirectly by buying the product of his labour
at too low a cost, in his capacity as manufacturer he exploits labour
direct. All commercial operations partake of this nature. Their aim is
always to defeat the ends of fair exchange by manipulating values. By so
doing, money is <em>made</em> as we say, and the problem of riches and
poverty is created. It is a bye-product of this abuse of exchange. For
this evil there is only one solution—the solution provided by the
Guilds—to fix the price of everything; for when all prices are fixed
there is no room left for the speculator. There is nothing to speculate
in.</p>
<p>The Guilds in the Middle Ages existed in the towns. But they never
came into existence in the rural areas. There were no agricultural
Guilds. This was the weak place in the Mediaeval economic armour; for it
is obvious that if the Just Price was finally to be maintained at all,
it would have to be maintained everywhere, both in town and country.
That Guilds were never organized in the rural areas is to be explained
immediately by the fact that in the eleventh and twelfth centuries, when
Guilds were organized in the towns, currency had not spread into rural
areas, for Feudalism existed there and exchange was still carried on by
barter. But the ultimate reason is to be found in the fact that the
function that the Guilds performed in the regulation of exchange and
currency was not understood at the time, while by the time currency had
spread into rural areas the validity of the Just Price had come to be
challenged by the lawyers, who maintained the right of every man to make
the best bargain he could for himself. They found authority for their
attitude in the Justinian Code, belief in the infallibility of which had
accompanied the revival of Roman law. This challenge undermined the
moral sanction on which the Just Price ultimately rested. It had the
success of an appeal to a lower motive,, and it was thus that the
revival of Roman law introduced into Mediaeval society those very
elements of corruption with which it had been associated at Rome. Its
ultimate effect has been to reproduce in the modern world those very
same economic difficulties and social disorders that paved the way for
the break up of the Roman Empire. For Roman law was not, like Mediaeval
law, designed to enable good men to live among bad, but to enable rich
men to live among poor; and as such it had been designed to bolster up,
in the interests of public order rather than for the maintenance of
justice, a society that had been rendered corrupt by an unregulated
currency.</p>
<p>While the lawyers were blind to the significance of the Just Price,
the Church was equally blind to the need of Guild organization for its
maintenance. It thought, as many religious people think to-day, that the
world can be regenerated by individual moral action alone. It never
realized that a high standard of commercial morality can only be
maintained if organizations exist to suppress a lower standard. Hence it
came about that while the Church inculcated the doctrine of the Just
Price in the pulpit, the confessional and the ecclesiastical courts, it
never stressed the need of organization; and so the peasants who
accepted such teaching found themselves eventually at the mercy of those
who followed the teaching of the lawyers. It was thus that the moral
sanction of the Just Price lost its hold on the country population and
the way was opened for the growth of capitalism and speculation. The
moral sanction of the Just Price being undermined, the Guilds found it
increasingly difficult to maintain fixed prices. In the sixteenth
century the whole system broke down entirely, as a consequence of the
suppression of the monasteries, which upset the economic equilibrium of
society, producing widespread unemployment, and the wholesale
importation of gold from South America, which doubled prices all over
Europe.</p>
<p>So ended the Guilds; and it is only recently that we have begun to
realize what the world lost with them. For they fulfilled a function of
fundamental importance to society, since in maintaining the Just Price
they prevented people from speculating in exchange. With their
disappearance society lost entire control over its economic
arrangements, and the world has been at the mercy of economic forces
ever since. It is no exaggeration to say that society will continue to
be at their mercy until the Guilds are restored, for by no other means
can speculating in exchange be suppressed. The restoration of the Guilds
therefore provides the key to the economic problem. The control of
prices is a precedent condition of success in any effort to secure
economic reform, inasmuch as until prices are fixed it will be
impossible to plan or arrange anything that may not be subsequently
upset by the fluctuations of the market. It is a necessary preliminary
to any securing of the unearned increment for the community, since until
prices are fixed it will always be possible for the rich to evade
attempts to reduce their wealth by transferring any taxation imposed
upon them on to the shoulders of other members of the community.</p>
</section>
<section id="how-the-great-change-may-come" class="level1">
<h1>How the Great Change may Come</h1>
<p>Granted then that it is essential to the solution of the problems
confronting us that prices be fixed and the Guilds restored, we must try
to answer the question: How is it to be done?</p>
<p>Here, to some extent, we enter the realm of uncertainty. The
translation of any idea into the terms of actuality depends upon
circumstances, and as it is impossible to foresee with precision what
will happen in the future, it is impossible to define exactly every step
that must be taken. On the other hand the popularization and acceptance
of any idea will, if there is any truth in it, tend to create the
circumstances necessary to its practical attainment. To some extent,
therefore, salvation is by faith and propaganda.</p>
<p>But it is not entirely a matter of faith. We have certain definite
things to go upon. We have unmistakable evidence that “the new social
order is developing its embryo within the womb of existing society.” In
the Trade Union movement, for instance, we have, to use Mr. Chesterton’s
words, “a return to the past by men ignorant of the past, like the
subconscious action of some man who has lost his memory.” In which light
the proposal to transform the Unions into Guilds is seen to be an effort
to give conscious direction to a movement which hitherto has been
entirely instinctive. There is, moreover, historical continuity in this
idea, inasmuch as the Trade Unions are the legitimate successors of the
Mediaeval Guilds; not only because the issues which concerned them could
not have arisen but for the defeat of the Guilds, but because they
acknowledge in their organizations a corresponding principle of growth.
The Unions to-day with their elaborate organizations exercise many of
the functions that were formerly performed by the Guilds—such as the
regulation of wages and hours of labour, in addition to the more social
duty of giving timely help to the sick and unfortunate. Like the Guilds,
the Unions have grown from small beginnings until they now control whole
trades. Like the Guilds also, they are not political creations, but
voluntary organizations that have arisen spontaneously to protect the
weaker members of society against the oppression of the powerful. They
differ from the Guilds only to the extent that, not being in possession
of industry and corresponding privileges, they are unable to accept
responsibility for the quality of work done and to regulate prices. But
their performance of this latter function cannot be withheld much
longer, for the growth of economic instability and uncertainty is
exercising such a paralysing influence upon the conduct of industry that
the instinct of self-preservation must before long compel a return to
the idea of a fixed and Just Price; and, as we saw that it is impossible
to maintain fixed prices for more than a few staple articles, by means
of bureaucratic control from without, it follows that any general
fixation of prices is impossible apart from the co-operation of each
trade as a whole. When membership of a trade organization is confined to
employers it exhibits the vices of a trust. But when it includes every
worker by hand or brain, it will display the virtues of a Guild. For
honesty and fair dealing will always find the support of the
majority.</p>
<p>But how may this necessity be translated into the terms of practical
politics? The success that has followed the organization of Building
Guilds in different parts of the country might appear to suggest that
the future is to be found by working upon such lines. But it is manifest
that there is a limit to such a policy of encroaching control. The
organization of Building Guilds was possible because of circumstances
peculiar to the building trade, i.e. the housing shortage which provided
the immediate opportunity; Labour controlled municipal councils that
were in a position to give them work; and the fact that in the building
trades the element of fixed capital, so important in other large
industries, is unimportant in comparison with the charges connected with
each particular job,—materials and labour entailing almost the whole
costs of the building industry. These circumstances made the application
of the principle of industrial self-government a fairly simple
proposition. But it obviously could not be applied to other large
industries where immense fixed capital is required, and where the market
is not so easily localized.</p>
<p>Considerations of this kind lead me to the conclusion that the Guilds
will arrive some other way. Recent developments lead me to suppose that
if the change will not be catastrophic it will at any rate be dramatic,
inasmuch as it is possible that their organization may be encouraged to
stabilize the exchanges. The demand of Labour that the Government should
step in and organize trade by barter with other nations, in order to
break down the barriers set up by the fluctuations of exchange, is
evidence that thought is moving in some such direction, for such a
departure would necessitate the organization of Guilds, as the only way
of avoiding the evils consequent upon the creation of enormous
Government departments to carry through the work. Moreover, except on a
Guild basis it will be impossible to guard against abuses. For if trade
were organized on a basis of national barter it would be necessary in
order to adjust shares of the industries engaged to put some price on
the outgoing and incoming goods. If this were left in the hands of
Government officials it would become as scandalous as the munition
contracts were during the war, for the Government would have to deal
with a crowd of profiteers who would think of nothing except how to
secure advantages for themselves, and the public outcry and
dissatisfaction would be as great as against the profiteers during the
war. For this problem there is but one solution, and that is for each
trade to be organized on a basis of self-government in order that prices
may be fixed and standards of conduct enforced or in other words by the
organization of Guilds. Precedent for such development is to be found in
the later days of the Roman Empire when the Government, having assumed
responsibility for the provision of an adequate food supply, began to
delegate functions to organized groups of workers. Our knowledge of what
happened in this way is very scanty, but there is sufficient evidence to
believe that a time came when efforts were made to balance the
centralizing bureaucratic tendency by decentralization as much as
possible, and that group organization on something resembling a Guild
basis came into existence.</p>
<p>Development upon such lines appears to me to be the probable thing.
But. meanwhile our manufacturers, who have taken fright at the prospect
of being undersold in the home markets, are pressing the Government to
bring in an Anti-Dumping Bill as it is called by those who are opposed
to it, or “The Safeguarding of our Industries Bill,” as it is called in
Government circles. The demand is evidently the result of panic, since
as far as I can ascertain the fear of dumping is largely unsupported by
facts. The Continent is not in a position to export goods in vast
quantities. On the contrary the depreciation of the exchange that has
scared our manufacturers is itself evidence that the Continent is
importing more than it is exporting,and the only remedy is for the
Continent to produce more. But if we refuse to take their goods it is
evident that their exports will cease and therefore our exports to
them.</p>
<p>It is to be observed that when things go wrong and people are at a
loss to understand the cause, they invariably seek salvation in the
adoption of a reversal of policy, whether it has anything to do with the
facts or not. Thus because it has so happened that since the war things
have not automatically adjusted themselves by Free Trade, they imagine a
remedy is to be found in Protection. But what reason is there to think
that this proposed remedy would not be worse than the disease? The
application of the principle of Free Trade in the past regardless of
circumstances may be regrettable. But is a general tariff imposed still
more regardless of circumstances likely to produce better results? Free
Trade may not contain all the truth some of its advocates claim. But it
does contain some truth that is valuable in a period of transition like
the present when exchanges have to be built up again.</p>
<p>The true alternative to Free Trade is not Protection, but a system of
fixed prices under Guild regulation. To the capitalist demand for
Protection the workers should reply that as it is undesirable for the
State to grant privileges except to those who are willing to accept
corresponding responsibilities, the only terms on which they may ask for
Protection is that they are willing to submit to Guild regulation; which
means that they must agree to sell their goods, in the home market at
any rate, at Fixed and Just Prices, and that they give the workers a
status in their respective industries. If such conditions were accepted,
the issue between Free Trade and Protection disappears, and here I would
observe that the function of a Guild is not to organize industry but to
regulate it in the same way that professional societies to-day enforce a
discipline among their members. All other issues, such as whether the
members of the Guild should be organized in self-governing workshops, or
whether they should have small workshops of their own as happened in the
Middle Ages, are secondary. They are matters of opinion, preference or
experience. But they are not germane to the idea of a Guild as an
organization enforcing a certain standard of conduct and efficiency over
a whole trade. My own opinion is that under the control of the Guilds,
different forms of workshop organization would exist. Men of gregarious
instincts would prefer the self-governing workshop, while men of a
masterful or solitary disposition would prefer to work alone. But they
would all have to abide by the Guild regulations, or suffer expulsion.
However, these things’ are largely a matter of opinion. If the Guilds
are to arrive dramatically it is manifest that they will have to adapt
themselves to the circumstances that exist. If we can secure a return to
the principles of honesty and fair dealing, that is all we can expect at
the beginning. The rest will follow in due course.</p>
<p>Once the guildization of industry takes place in one country, the
example will speedily be followed by others. For the problem is
international. All the nations of the earth are having to face the same
problem and learn the same lesson at the same time. All are engaged
together in the bitter but salutary process of discovering their
souls—some as victors, the others as vanquished. They are all getting
heartily sick of the economic struggle; while the rich who hitherto have
obstructed the path of reform are nowadays on the defensive. We may be
assured therefore that whatever vision is coming to ourselves as a
result of the breakdown of our civilization, similar visions are coming
to others; and may it not be that beneath the class hatreds, beneath the
oppositions of the hour, a profound principle of unity is at work, and
that our late enemies may, when at last some ray of light breaks, rise
simultaneously with ourselves to substitute international co-operation
for international strife and competition? With fixed prices throughout
industry, economic competition would automatically come to an end, and
with it cross distribution would tend to disappear; for no one would be
tempted to buy goods at a distance for some temporary advantage of gain.
The qualitative ideal of production would tend to replace the
quantitative one, for as the reinvestment of surplus wealth would no
longer be possible it would no longer go to provide more machinery for
more cut-throat competition, but would tend to be spent on the arts,
upon building, education, and the other amenities of civilization.
Pleasure would be restored to work.</p>
<p>It will have been noticed that I have discussed the coming of the new
social order in the terms of Guilds and currency rather than in the
terms of property, as customary in Socialist circles. The reason for
this is that I am persuaded that to begin with property is to tackle the
problem at the wrong end, and the difficulty experienced in translating
the labour programme into action is due finally to that fact. At every
step in the reconstruction of society it will be necessary to interfere
with property, yet all the same the centre of gravity of the economic
problem is to be found in currency rather than property; for currency is
the vital thing, the thing of movement, it is the active principle in
economic development, while property is the passive. It is true that
profits that are made by the manipulation of currency sooner or later
assume the form of property, but the root mischief is not to be found in
property but in unregulated currency. To solve the problem of currency
by the institution of the Just Price under a system of Guilds, is to
bring order into the economic problem at its active centre. Having
solved the problem at its centre, it will be a comparatively easy matter
to deal with property, which lies at the circumference. Property owners
would be able to offer no more effective resistance to change than
hitherto landlordism has been able to offer to the growth of capitalism.
By such means the reconstruction of society would proceed upon orderly
lines. All it would be necessary to do would be to exert a steady and
constant pressure over a decade or so, and society would be transformed
completely. But to begin with property is to get things out of their
natural order, for it is to proceed from the circumference to the
centre, which is contrary to the law of growth. It is to precipitate
economic confusion by dragging up society by its roots; and this defeats
the ends of revolution by strengthening the hands of the profiteer; for
the profiteer thrives on economic confusion. Of what use is it to seek
to effect a redistribution of wealth before the profiteer has been got
under control? since so long as men are at liberty to manipulate
exchange, they will manage somehow to get the wealth of the community
into their hands. Thus, we see that the solution of the social problem,
as indeed of every other problem in this universe, resolves itself
finally into one of order. Take issues in their natural order and
everything will straighten itself out beautifully. All the minor details
or secondary parts will fall into their proper places. But approach
these same issues in a wrong order and confusion results. No subsequent
adjustments can remedy the initial error. This principle is universally
true. It is as true of writing a book or of designing a building, as of
conducting a revolution. The secret of success in each case will be
found finally to rest upon the perception of the order in which the
various issues should be taken.</p>

<section id="agriculture-and-emigration" class="level1">
<h1>Agriculture and Emigration</h1>
<p>The corollary of the substitution for international competition of
international co-operation is the revival of agriculture, for it implies
a return to the idea of communities that are as self-contained as
circumstances will allow; and such communities inevitably rest upon
agriculture.</p>
<p>In an earlier chapter I showed that the revival of agriculture was
necessary alike to the solution of our unemployed problem and to provide
us with food now that the days of our industrial supremacy are numbered.
But it is necessary also for another reason: to ensure a healthy
population. It came as a surprise to most people in this country that
recruiting statistics revealed the fact that we had a larger percentage
of physical inefficients than any other country at war. But it is not
surprising, remembering that no other country in the world has such a
large proportion of her population living in crowded towns nor been
industrialized for anything like the same length of time. These
statistics prove that a town population gradually loses its vitality. In
the past this vitality was every generation renewed by a stream of
population from the country. In this light a peasantry on the soil is to
be regarded as a reservoir from which the towns replenish their stock,
and therefore agriculture stands on a different basis to that of any
other industry, and its welfare should be protected at all costs. From a
mercantile point of view it matters little whether the population be
engaged in the production of food or motor-cars. But from a national
point of view there is all the difference in the world, since the
production of food guarantees a nation’s future while the production of
motor-cars does not. Yet when we remember how big business dominates
national policy we cannot be surprised that, being, as we saw, heedless
of its own future it should be equally heedless of that of the nation.
If, therefore, one aspect of the return to fundamentals is a return to
the principles of justice, honesty and fair dealing, the other aspect is
a return to the land; to a life lived in closer contact with the
elemental forces of nature.</p>
<p>When one thinks of the revival of agriculture, or the colonization of
England as some would prefer to call it, the first obstacle one feels to
be in its path is the great discrepancy between the earnings of the town
and of the country workers. The first step towards reform therefore
demands that the wages of agricultural workers be raised. The recently
formed unions of agricultural workers are doing invaluable work in this
direction. But they are meeting and will continue to meet with the
resistance of the farmers to their demands, and it is doubtful whether
the farm labourers will ever be in a sufficiently strong position to
force the hands of the farmers very much. For there is only one time in
the year when they could strike with advantage to themselves, and that
is at harvest time. Even then their success would be doubtful. The
resistance of the farmers to such demands we are apt to ascribe to a
grasping nature. But I doubt whether it can entirely be attributed to
that. The uncertainties of farming due to natural causes are increased
tenfold by the effects of speculation, and the returns of one harvest
may be swept away by the manipulation of prices in distant financial
centres. So the farmer’s one idea is to build up a reserve against a
possible change of fortune, and this constant preoccupation tends to
develop in time a mean and grasping disposition.But the difficulty could
be got over by a changed attitude towards questions relating to
agriculture. Prices must continue to be guaranteed by the Government,
and there must be no question of a return to the old system of
competitive prices, as there would be no question if the implications
were understood. In consideration for such guaranteed prices, the
farmers should agree to raise the wages of their labourers.</p>
<p>At first sight this suggestion seems to be rather Utopian; and no
doubt it will so remain as long as the Coalition remains in power. But
would it be different if a Labour Government held the reins? I am not
sure. For while the Coalition would doubtless refuse to act in this way
out of fear of Labour becoming too powerful, a Labour Government might
find difficulties owing to jealousies in the ranks of Labour. The Labour
Party is responsible to its own supporters, and as it consists mainly of
town workers it is possible that it would object to such action on the
grounds that it was creating a privileged class of workers. This is not
entirely a matter of imagination. The Building Guilds have found
themselves up against this kind of thing. Propagandists on their behalf
have found opposition to them from other classes of workers who fear
that the workers in the building trade may become a privileged class.
This is one of the weaknesses of the Socialist appeal. For whereas the
doctrine of Socialism is espoused by many (I hope the majority) from
altruistic motives, it has nevertheless secured the support of large
bodies of workers by its appeal to their immediate self-interest; and
self-interest is apt to be short-sighted. In this case it has led the
workers to demand an impossibility—that any advantages that accrue to
Labour shall accrue to all at one and the same time.</p>
<p>Perhaps the most practical way of meeting this difficulty is to get
into the minds of the workers some idea of the structure of society, and
the need of drastic reconstruction. Very few of them to-day have any
idea that society needs to be reconstructed. They are of course familiar
with the word, but not, I fear, with the idea. The evils of society,
they have been told, are incident to capitalism, and they imagine that
once a Labour Government is returned to power capitalism will be
abolished and we shall live happily ever afterwards. Beyond that they do
not go. They have no idea that society is crumbling to pieces, and needs
to be rebuilt in the same way that a house that is falling down will
need to be rebuilt, and that in rebuilding society it is no more
possible for the benefits that are to be conferred upon Labour to be
conferred simultaneously upon all, than it is possible in building a
house for all the bricks to be laid at one and the same time. Nor can
they have any idea until differentiation is made between primary and
secondary production, and they come to realize that in any rebuilding of
society it is necessary to deal with primary activities before it is
possible to deal with secondary ones.</p>
<p>The idea needs to be popularized that agriculture is fundamental;
that it forms the base of the pyramid of production; and that as it has
been allowed to decline in this country the reconstruction of
agriculture must take precedence over all other industries. The revival
of agriculture is immediately important, because it would absorb so many
of our unemployed; a thing that is so obvious that one wonders how it is
that in the present crisis the two are never connected by our leaders.
But the case is even stronger still in the long run, since, if we
neglect to revive agriculture, it is a certainty that in a few years’
time we shall be left without food; for, as I have already pointed out,
the countries that supplied us with food are taking to manufactures, so
they will not require our goods. Therefore, as we shall have nothing to
give them in exchange for food, we must take to growing our own.</p>
<p>But there are deeper reasons than these of mere expediency why
agriculture should be revived. If the economic problem is to be handled
successfully we must be as self-supporting as possible. It is simply
impossible to initiate drastic reform so long as our industries are
dependent upon foreign markets, for in this case the factors governing
the problem are outside of our control. The modification of a tariff or
a war, the discovery of some new raw material or some other such event
in some remote corner of the globe, dislocates the labour of those at
home, while all the time our fortunes remain in the hands of capitalist
adventurers. Under a system of international markets the workers become
parasitic upon the capitalist, because he alone can find outlets for
goods. Indeed, so long as industry is dependent upon foreign markets,
production will be very much of a gamble. It will depend upon
speculation, and this is incompatible with the reconstruction of
society. But if agriculture were revived, a large home market would
become available. If the agricultural worker were paid as he should be
paid, it would react to the benefit of the town workers by relieving the
pressure of competition in the towns. We should soon find that a
prosperous peasantry was our greatest economic asset. The raising of the
wages of the agricultural workers would, moreover by putting the
labourers on their feet again, pave the way for the organization of
Agricultural Guilds. Such Guilds would regulate prices, be centres of
mutual aid, buy and sell and do the other work undertaken by
agricultural organization societies. They should, moreover, administer
the land; and in this connection I would suggest that the land should be
owned as well as administered by the local Guilds. This suggestion is
offered as an alternative to nationalization, in order to avoid the
evils of bureaucracy.</p>
<p>The Agricultural Guilds would be mixed or undifferentiated
organizations. They might be likened to the Guilds Merchants of the
Middle Ages to the extent that the village carpenters, smiths and other
isolated workers would be included in them, and also that the functions
of the parish councils would be merged in them in the same way that the
Guilds merchant and municipalities were identical; or they might be
likened to the village communes of pre-feudal days, differing from them
to the extent that whereas the village communes exchanged by barter,
these Agriculture Guilds would regulate currency by means of fixed
prices. It may also be assumed that the strip system would not be
reverted to. As to whether land is best cultivated on large or small
holdings I am not prepared to dogmatize, as opinion of those with
practical experience is so divided. But, after all, it is a secondary
matter, and one that may well be left for the Guilds themselves to
decide. It would be an important issue if our ideal were one of peasant
proprietors, but not if the country is to be colonized by groups of
workers organized into Guilds.</p>
<p>Colonization by groups is also the key to the problem of emigration.
What is so distasteful to most people in connection with emigration
to-day is the isolated feeling of the man who emigrates alone; for not
only is he separated from his friends, but he is left entirely to his
own initiative; and town-bred people naturally hesitate from venturing
upon a career so full of hazards. Such men when they do emigrate rarely
settle down in the land of their adoption. They cherish the hope of
making a pile and returning home. It is this spirit that has corrupted
colonial life, and has brought into existence in our colonies in less
than a century social problems as bad if not worse than ours which have
taken centuries to develop. This was not the case with the early
emigrants who settled in America and elsewhere. They founded societies
which were comparatively stable; and not the least of the things that
enabled them to found such societies was that some of the old Mediaeval
communal spirit survived among them; and so they emigrated in groups, a
custom that has survived among Italians and Eastern Europeans to this
day. And this fact makes all the difference. For when men and women
emigrate in groups they are held together by personal and human ties,
and can render each other mutual aid and support. In consequence they
settle down in a way that emigrants who go individually never do. We
were successful in the past as a colonizing power because this communal
spirit obtained; colonization has become impossible with us now because
of the individualism that is rampant. For this individualism has built
up trusts and syndicates and other monopolies that suck the life-blood
out of the emigrant</p>

<section id="machinery-and-unemployment" class="level1">
<h1>Machinery and Unemployment</h1>
<p>The revival of agriculture raises the question of the employment of
machinery, and this in turn raises so many other questions that it is
necessary to pause and consider them.</p>
<p>At the moment, I am not concerned to discuss whether, considered in
the abstract, machinery is or is not a desirable thing, since making no
claims to be anything more than a means to an end, it can be
demonstrated to be either good or bad, according to the philosophy we
hold. It is hopeless, therefore, to attempt to secure acceptance of any
conclusion regarding its ultimate use until some unanimity of opinion is
first established in the realms of philosophy and belief. But meanwhile
we are confronted with a very practical question about which we must
make up our minds: What is to be our primary aim in reviving
agriculture? Is it to provide us with food, or to find work for the
unemployed, or what? The question is a pertinent one, because the
defence of unregulated machinery has hitherto rested on the belief that
in the long run it would emancipate mankind from the curse of Adam by
reducing labour to a minimum and thus set us free to pursue the higher
ends of life. As to whether most of those who may claim to have been so
liberated show any disposition to follow higher pursuits, I do not for
the moment inquire, though the “Gentleman with a Duster” has a different
tale to tell. But it may be observed that nowadays when this prophecy
that machinery is destined to liberate mankind from the necessity of
toil shows some signs of being fulfilled, when for the moment we have
produced enough and to spare, we are panic-stricken at the army of
unemployed in our streets and worry ourselves to death to find them some
work to do. The situation reminds us of an ancient Hindu story of a man
who went to a great yogi for a formula to raise the devil. The yogi was
quite willing to oblige him, but warned him before doing so that once
the devil was raised up he must be kept in employment or he would turn
and devour him. The man, however, was not to be intimidated, so he took
the formula and raised the devil by his incantations; he had plenty of
work, and managed for a long time to keep the devil fully occupied. But
a time came when work began to run out, and he lived in terror of his
destruction at the hands of the unemployed monster. In desperation he
went back to the yogi to seek advice. “Well,” said the yogi, “I told you
what to expect. But do not despair. Take this dog to your devil and ask
him to straighten its tail. That will keep him busy for ever.” Even so
is it with our industrial system, not leisure but terror is at the end
of its story. We must find it work to do, and the only work we can find
is about as utilitarian as straightening the dog’s tail.</p>
<p>Now the reason why we act in such illogical, contradictory ways
towards machinery is because in proportion as it tends to become
automatic it raises questions which nobody can answer. If machinery is
to reduce labour to a minimum, then it follows that some other method of
payment must be instituted from the one customary to-day. For payment
to-day is for work done, and that is no use if work is to be abolished.
The necessity of making some such fundamental change is at the back of
the minds of some of those who devise credit schemes and advocate
consumer’s credits which are to be distributed independent of work done.
None of these schemes will bear looking into. But they do face up to a
difficulty that the modern world prefers to ignore: how people are to be
paid in the machine society. Perhaps an effort to find a solution of
this problem is the clue to Marx, and is what he was really after when
he advocated the abolition of the wage system. Anyway, he makes his
whole theory of social evolution dependent upon the development of
machinery. He saw clearly that the machine era would end in the dilemma
that faces us to-day, inasmuch as the end of machine production was to
be the creation of an unemployed problem that could not be solved by the
time-honoured methods. The solution he proposed was of the nature of a
leap in the dark. The unemployed were to rise, take possession of the
means of production and exchange, and at the end of it was his
structureless Communist state. That was as far as he saw. His thinking
came to an end at the point where the real difficulties begin, and
viewing the problem to-day at closer quarters it is not quite as simple
as it appeared to Marx. We can see the unemployed problem but not the
Communist state arising out of it, though we do see the possibility of
revolution.</p>
<p>For my own part, I do not believe that there is a solution of this
problem on modernist lines. It seems to me that the tradition of payment
for work done is so deep-rooted that men will continue to think and act
in such terms in spite of the fact that this tradition is challenged by
the use of machinery. The difficulty is to think in any other terms, and
I feel it to be a part of wisdom to accept the present method of
distributing purchasing power by means of payment for work done as
irrevocable, whatever the implications may be. For of the choices before
us, either the abolition of such a means of distributing purchasing
power or limiting the use of machinery, the latter seems to me
simplicity itself compared with the former, for I can think in the terms
of the latter but not of the former, and neither, apparently, can any
one else. Those who try go mad.</p>
<p>Assuming, then, that the present method of distributing purchasing
power is to persist, it follows that our aim should be to regulate
machinery in such a way as not to dislocate our method of payment for
work done, and in this connection it is to be observed that the
opportunity for reducing such a principle to practice presents itself in
connection with the revival of agriculture. For agriculture is
fundamental, and we could build on its base a new society that would
gradually replace our present one. In this sense we get a new start, and
it is up to us to make up our minds now. The question arises in
connection with the use of agricultural machinery. To what extent is it
to be used? During the war it was everywhere encouraged because it was a
matter of urgency to produce food. But if agriculture is to be revived
now it will have the further object of providing work for the
unemployed. Let us therefore face the fact that the more machinery we
employ the less work there will be for the unemployed. Hence, if our
primary aim be to provide work for the unemployed, the less machinery we
use the better. On the contrary, if we decide that it is foolishness not
to use machinery, let us be clear what we are going to do with the
unemployed. To my way of thinking, there is only one sane thing to do if
machinery is to be used, and that is to employ the same number of men as
would be required if no machinery were used, and to reduce the number of
hours worked as more machinery is used. For I insist that in all such
questions consideration of the human factor should come first. I believe
the ultimate cause of our confusion is to be found in the fact that it
is our custom to put it last, and to assume that the right thing to do
is to put other considerations—financial or mechanical—first, leaving
the human factor to take care of itself as best it can. Let us hope that
the magnitude of the present unemployed problem which refuses to solve
itself will be the precursor of better things by forcing upon us the
necessity of giving human considerations the first place.</p>
<p>One of the advantages of the solution I suggest is that while
machinery would be used, we should not be at its mercy, for the economic
system would be independent of it. Supposing, for instance, a day came
when owing to the shortage of petrol the use of tractors had to be
abandoned, the economic system would not break down, for it would be
constructed with a margin of safety. All it would mean would be that
those employed upon the land would have to work longer hours. If
machinery were employed in this way it would do the things it professes
to do. It would reduce drudgery, and it would give more leisure, and it
is possible that craft developments might follow, for there is no reason
why home crafts should not be joined up to the pursuit of agriculture in
the future as in the past, when the long winter evenings were employed
in this way. Any additional leisure that the use of machinery would give
might be so employed, though as a man’s living would be secured by his
agricultural earnings, it would be optional. The objection to the use of
machinery would fall to the ground if its actual use corresponded to its
theoretical justification. But what hitherto has made all discussion on
the subject so hopeless, is that while in practice machinery is used for
one purpose, it is theoretically justified for another, while belief in
its benevolence was so confident and absolute that it seemed to matter
little to people what motive prompted its use so long as it was used. We
must break with this sloppy-minded attitude towards machinery, and learn
to reason about it as we reason about other things, for it is a
certainty we shall never be able to control it until we think
intelligently about it.</p>
<p>But there are other and more fundamental questions connected with the
use of machinery that must not be lost sight of. One of these is the
exhaustion of natural resources which follows its unregulated use.
Mention has been made of the petrol shortage. It is estimated that the
supply in America will only last another twenty-five years. We are
engaged in a war in Mesopotamia to secure another source of supply.
America has designs upon Mexico for the same object. Borings are being
made to discover a source of supply in this country; no doubt there are
others. But some day or other there will be no more, and it is sheer
folly, to say the least, to commit ourselves to methods of production
and transport that depend upon supplies that are limited. For under such
circumstances our position will become desperate as natural resources
tend to become exhausted. To reduce the position to its lowest
denomination in the terms of cash, the cost of the wars in which we
shall be involved in order to get possession of new sources of supply
ought to be counted against any savings that are made in other
directions, and what is true of petrol is true of other materials.
Industrial production uses up all materials at such an alarming rate
that some day we shall be left hard and dry if the matter is not taken
in hand. It would be well for us to be forewarned in time, and now that
the opportunity of a fresh start presents itself, some reason should be
brought to bear on the question. If we lay it down as a maxim that the
first principle of a normal civilization is that it should be as
self-contained as possible, the second is that it should in no sense be
living upon capital, but should arrange its production in such a way
that it should largely reproduce itself. This is not entirely possible,
for we must make use of mineral wealth to some extent. But wisdom
suggests that our resources should be conserved and not wasted in the
reckless, spend-thrift way we are accustomed to do. Our newspapers are
full of indignation against the waste by Government Departments, but
scarcely a word is ever said of the thousand times more serious waste of
natural resources, though one would have thought that the paper shortage
should have made them think.</p>
<p>The modern problem is so elusive that it is generally difficult to
prove a certain tendency to be evil or dangerous. We may, however, test
the truth of many tendencies by their bearing upon agriculture, and here
it is to be observed that the tendency of all modern developments is to
rob agriculture of its manures. Human and animal manures are natural
fertilizers. In this respect hitherto there existed a reciprocal
relationship between man and nature. Food consumed was returned to the
earth as manures. But when the water-carriage system of sewage came
along with its superior convenience, which is undeniable, this chain of
reciprocity was broken, and resource was had to chemical manures, and
the guano deposits of South America. Attention was called to this
problem twenty-five years ago by Dr. Vivien Poore, who wrote a book on
the subject, <em>Rural Hygiene</em>, the object of which was to prevent
the spread of the water-carriage system of sewage into rural areas. He
showed how the water-carriage of sewage produced the typhoid fever germ;
that our sanitary measures were designed to protect ourselves against
this germ; how introduced into rural areas it poisoned water supplies
and necessitated enormous expenditure on schemes to get water from
distant and unpolluted sources; that the manurial value of the human
excrement was destroyed by water-carriage, and that chemical manures
were no substitute for the natural organic manures. But the warning was
ignored, the water-carriage system was convenient, and the manufacture
of sanitary goods was a vested interest, and so nothing was done. One
more problem was added for posterity to solve. Since the development of
motor transport the problem is aggravated, for it robs agriculture of
horse manures. When mention is made of these things, the reply we get
is, that in the future it will be possible to extract the nitrogen from
the air. Whether or not this is a really practical proposition, or
whether the nitrogen will remain eternally in the air I do not know, but
it illustrates the thoughtless way in which we are content to go on. We
study only our immediate convenience, create enormous problems, and
trust to sheer chance to getting out of them. The many and wonderful
discoveries of science have apparently reacted to create this spirit. It
prevents us from exercising any forethought in respect to things of a
fundamental nature by confirming us in the belief that something is
bound to turn up. Our national life is lived after the manner of a
spendthrift who is prepared to squander one fortune on the chance of
another being left to him.</p>
<p>Again, this thoughtlessness is encouraged by the complexity and pace
of modern life—a consequence of the misapplication of machinery—which
militates against reflection and clear thinking of all kinds. Nowadays
there is no time for anything, the complexity of our society bewilders
people. No one can deny these things, yet if it is true that the
development of speed and complexity beyond a certain point is evil, then
we have a clear case for the regulation of machinery. But here we run up
against the prejudices of the thoughtful just as much as the
thoughtless. Let us examine them.</p>
<p>Take first the economists. They will deny <em>in toto</em> the
existence of a machine problem, affirming that the evils that have
accompanied the use of machinery are due entirely to the peculiar
economic conditions which existed at the time of its introduction, or in
other words, that machinery has been misapplied because it arrived at a
time when the accepted social gospel was that of economic individualism,
from which it follows that what we have to do is to substitute some form
of economic co-operation for economic individualism when the machine
problem would automatically solve itself. But is such reasoning valid?
If it be true, as I am willing to admit, that the economic problem
preceded the machine problem, and is therefore more fundamental, it is
equally true that morals are more fundamental than economics. If,
therefore, our practical activity is to be related only to those things
that are fundamental, then it must be based upon morals and not upon
economics. Economists can’t have it both ways. Either we base our
activities upon ultimate truth, in which case we abandon economics and
pursue morals, or we base them upon a series of proximate truths, in
which case the problem of machinery takes its place alongside that of
economics. We may agree that the substitution of economic co-operation
for economic individualism must precede the control of machinery, but
such co-operation would not ensure its control in the face of the
popular prejudice in favour of its unrestricted use.</p>
<p>But economists are not the only people with prejudices on this
question. There are the moralists who affirm that there is no such thing
as a machine problem, inasmuch as machinery is non-moral, and its
application will, therefore, be good or bad according to the motive that
inspires its use. The weakness of this argument is that it assumes that
the intelligence of the user corresponds always with his moral
intention. We know that in other departments of activity this does not
by any means follow, and that a man’s motive may be good and his actions
bad, or <em>vice versa</em>. The case, therefore, for regulating
machinery rests finally on precisely the same grounds as any other kind
of regulation. Firstly, to restrain those whose motives are bad from
injuring society by their actions, and secondly, to prevent those who
with the best of motives do through ignorance things which in their
ultimate effects are harmful.</p>
<p>But how may machinery be regulated? What kind of regulation is
needed? The answer is that our attack must not be directed primarily at
machinery, but at the system of the division of labour that lies behind
it. For that system was the great factor in the destruction of the
creative impulse in industry, and we may be sure it will not reappear
until it is destroyed. Moreover, the abolition of the division of labour
cuts at the very base of the quantitative ideal of production, which is
immediately responsible for the misapplication of machinery. If we keep
in mind the central idea—the general principle that machinery needs to
be subordinated to man—I think we shall find that, generally speaking,
the issue is one between large and small machines. We should forbid
large machines in production on the principle that large machinery tends
to enslave man because he must sacrifice himself mentally and morally to
keep it in commission, whereas the use of small machines has not this
effect, because they can be turned on and off at will, as, for instance,
is the case with a sewing machine. Exceptions would have to be made to
this rule, as in the case of pumping and lifting machinery where no
question of keeping it in commission necessarily enters. The difficulty
of deciding whether a machine was or was not harmful would not be
difficult to determine once the general principle were admitted that
machinery needs to be subordinated to man.</p>

<section id="on-morals-and-economics" class="level1">
<h1>On Morals and Economics</h1>
<p>I concluded the last chapter by answering objections of doctrinaire
economists and moralists to the regulation of machinery. As it is not
improbable that they will object to my general position, it is necessary
for me to anticipate their attacks. The economists will object to the
conception of the Just Price because it involves moral considerations,
and they demand an economic solution of the problem of society that is
independent of morals; the moralists, on the contrary, will maintain
that my policy is impracticable inasmuch as it presupposes a moral
revolution to make it effective.</p>
<p>Respecting the economic objection, I deny <em>in toto</em> that there
is any such thing as a purely economic solution of our problems, because
I do not believe that there is such a thing as a fool-proof society. The
search for it is as hopeless as the search for perpetual motion, and it
has been at the bottom of all the confusion in Socialist economics and
policy in the past. It is responsible, too, for the gulf that separates
formal Socialist theory from its informal philosophy. Of course it is to
be admitted that there are certain things in economics in which morals
play no part. Such factors in the economic situation as the inequalities
of nature, the fluctuations due to a good or bad harvest, have nothing
to do with morals. But such things do not impugn the fact that economics
in the larger sense presupposes certain moral assumptions any more than
because a man’s life is determined partly by accidental circumstances it
is to be explained apart from morals. This heresy goes back to Ricardo.
Before he wrote economists always based their reasoning upon certain
moral assumptions. They were either like the Mediaeval economists
concerned to understand how economic managements could be brought into
relation with the highest morality, or like Adam Smith they postulated
human selfishness as the motive force of economic activity. But what
they never thought of doing was to affirm the existence of economics
apart from morals. In the hands of Marx this heresy received a new
development. He turned the tables completely, inasmuch as he made morals
dependent upon economics, and this way of reasoning has persisted among
the more doctrinaire elements in the Socialist movement ever since, in
spite of the fact that Ruskin nearly fifty years ago exposed the fallacy
in the first few pages of <em>Unto this Last</em>. The reason for the
survival of this fallacy is perhaps to be found in the fact that at the
present time it seems impossible to interfere with the course of
economic development by action of a purely moral order. But this is to
be misled by appearance, for moral action only influences economic
development over a long period of time, the moral action of one
generation determining the economic environment of the next. It is this
that leads so many people to suppose that economics and morals exist
apart.</p>
<p>I have more sympathy with the objection that will be raised by the
moralists, because they happen to be right in theory, but mistaken as to
the actual facts. It is not true to say that the maintenance of the Just
Price presupposes a higher moral development than that which exists
to-day. For this again is to be misled by appearances. The popular
outcry during the war against profiteering demonstrates that moral
standards still exist among the people, while the success of the
Socialist movement as I explained in the first chapter is due to the
fact that it has some qualities of a moral revolt. It is true that
Socialists have been primarily concerned with the popularization of
certain economic doctrines, but in order to obtain a hearing for them
they have been obliged to attack the ideal of wealth. It has thus come
about as a consequence of these attacks, repeated from one end of the
country to the other during this last thirty years, that a changed moral
attitude towards wealth has come into existence, and has influenced
large bodies of people entirely unaffected by Socialist theories. I
think it is no exaggeration to say that in this direction the Socialist
movement has accomplished a moral revolution comparable only to that
effected by the Early Christians, who attacked wealth as vigorously as
any Socialist, though perhaps with a different object. Recognizing this,
I feel it ill becomes moralists who have rarely attacked wealth at all
to talk about the need of a moral revolution before the Just Price and
other measures could be established. They should be told that the moral
revolution in this direction is an accomplished fact.</p>
<p>The awakening of the public conscience in regard to collective
morality should not be overlooked because simultaneously with it
personal morality has suffered a decline. To some extent that decline is
doubtless due to certain Socialist teachers, though not to the influence
of the movement as a whole. To a far greater extent it is to be
attributed to the economic pressure under which most people live in
these days. Sexual morality is not improved by the fact that such a
large proportion of the rising generation find it difficult to marry,
nor does overcrowding and the housing shortage improve matters. While
again the commercial morality imposed by large concerns upon those they
employ gets steadily lower and lower. But what men do under duress
scarcely affects their character at all. Father Dolling, after years of
intimate experience of the Portsmouth underworld, an environment of
almost inevitable vice and crime, came to the conclusion that its
inhabitants were comparatively spiritually innocent. “Our falls in
Portsmouth,” he says, “entailed no complete destruction of character,
hardly any disfigurement at all. Boys stole, because stealing seemed to
them the only method of living—girls sinned—unconscious of any shame in
it, regarding it as a necessary circumstance of life if they were to
live at all. The soul unquickened, the body alone is depraved, and,
therefore, the highest part is still capable of the most beautiful
development.”It is the same in the commercial world. Men pursue immoral
methods in business, because it seems to them the only way of living,
and remain unconscious of any sin in the matter. When they do become
conscious they revolt. The Socialist movement draws its recruits from
among those who are in moral revolt, and that is why I am persuaded it
is only finally to be understood as a moral revival. Socialists talk
about changing the system, not because they are indifferent to morality,
but because they realize the impossibility of acting on moral precepts
amid such adverse circumstances. Such being the motive force behind the
demand for a change of the system, there is no reason to doubt that the
moral effort necessary to the enforcement of the Just Price will be
forthcoming. Nay, it can be said that nothing less than a desire to
enforce such principles of honesty and fair dealing could suffice to
bring the Guilds into existence.</p>
<p>What may be doubted, it seems to me, is not whether the moral effort
necessary to the maintenance of the Just Price under a system of Guilds
would, in the event of their establishment, be forthcoming, but whether
our attachment to city life may not stand in the way of a revival of
agriculture until it is too late. The town worker has become accustomed
to a life of bustle, crowded streets, trams, railways, cinemas, etc.,
that makes him restless under simpler conditions. He has, moreover,
become dependent upon a complicated machine. That machine allots to him
a single specialized task and supplies his other needs. In consequence
he has lost the habit of doing things for himself, and depends more and
more upon buying what he needs, and this has undermined those qualities
of resourcefulness, forethought and patience that are the necessary
accompaniment of an agricultural life. To break with this tradition
before the system comes to grief is the real obstacle in our path, for
everything combines against us. We have not only to contend with the
inertia common to all reform, but with the rooted habits of city
populations. And it may be that just as it was impossible to make people
realize the possibility of a European War before it was upon us, so it
will be impossible to induce people to realize our industrial position
until starvation threatens us if more food is not produced. If this is
the case we shall drift and drift until the only way of meeting the
situation will be some form of agricultural conscription, and our
countryside will be dotted with tents and huts to house workers engaged
in a desperate effort to cope with the problem of food. That is what
things must come to if we do not wake up before long. Meanwhile it is
the plain duty of publicists of all kinds to bring home to the people
the realities of the situation—to make them face the facts, and in the
short space of time allotted to us to assist in the cultivation by every
means at our disposal of such habits of industry and self-reliance as

<h1>Industrialism and Credit</h1>
<p>IT has been my aim in this little volume to concentrate attention on
certain issues that I feel to be primary and fundamental. There are
other things that must be done, such as the liquidation of the war loan,
but on this issue I have nothing to add to what has already been said by
others. The expenditure of surplus wealth by the rich in the ways it
used to be spent would also do much to mitigate the evils of
unemployment. But no one at the present time can act in these matters
except the rich, and as it seems impossible to persuade them to do
anything that ultimately matters, it is just as well to base our
politics upon the assumption that they will continue as at
present—hoping against hope and doing nothing.</p>
<p>The reason why we should concentrate our attention upon the things
that are fundamental is precisely because they have been for so long
neglected, while their importance to us is proportionate to their
neglect. They were neglected because, as I have said before, they are
antipathetic to industrialism, and industrialism appeared before the war
to be built upon a rock, and few believed it carried within itself the
seeds of its own destruction. On the contrary, the world was cursed with
an easy-going belief that though evils undoubtedly existed they were
merely incidental to the system, and could be remedied by half-baked
measures of reform. But that serene self-confidence nowadays is gone,
and I can write in a different way. It is no longer necessary for me to
plead for recognition of the fact that internal evidence pointed to the
break-up of our industrial civilization, since nowadays we can see it
dissolving before our very eyes—the only evidence which the modern world
is prepared to believe. In these circumstances self-preservation
suggests that delay is dangerous, and that it is necessary to get to
work at once to build the new society before the existing one breaks
down completely.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, those who still retain any belief in the possibility of
saving existing society from disruption are concentrating on the
problems of credit. With the effort of those who are attempting to
overcome the barriers to a revival of foreign trade set up by the
depreciation of the exchanges, and with those who would break the
monopoly of the banks, I have every sympathy. But with those who imagine
that the problems of credit can be cured by some Morrison’s Pill it is
different. In my opinion they are living in a world of illusions. One of
these pill schemes, that formulated by Major C. H. Douglas, and for
which the <em>New Age</em> has stood sponsor, demands special
consideration, since, as the editor of that journal acted as sponsor for
National Guilds, it has come to be discussed as if it were an approach
to the Guilds.</p>
<p>It will not be necessary for us to consider this scheme in all its
details. It will be sufficient for us to discuss its central idea. And
here I would observe that though I cannot accept Major Douglas’s scheme,
I recognize that he has attacked a real problem, though I may add that
to some of us it is not a new one. Briefly, then, Major Douglas faces
the fact that the policy of Maximum Production inevitably results in a
deadlock, upsetting the balance between demand and supply, but instead
of tracing it to the causes I have enumerated in Chapters 3, 4 and
5—that is ultimately to certain moral causes—he ignores morals entirely,
and traces the phenomenon entirely to its immediate cause in our system
of credit. This leads him to seek a solution of the problem in the terms
of accountancy. He proposes to correct the discrepancy between demand
and supply by selling goods below cost. There is, of course, nothing new
in selling below cost. Manufacturers have resorted to it in every
financial crisis when they have overproduced, to get rid of their
surplus stocks. What is new is this: Appreciating the fact that the
present financial crisis is no ordinary one that will pass by the normal
operations of supply and demand, he exalts a practice that has hitherto
been resorted to as a measure of temporary expediency into a permanent
principle of finance. For according to Major Douglas, the selling price
of articles must always be below cost, while he proposes that the
difference between the actual costs of production and the selling price
shall be made up to the producers by the Government in treasury notes.
That is the gist of the scheme. It is the only idea we need discuss, as
the others are merely accessory to it.</p>
<p>Now, the first and most obvious objection to this scheme is that such
a wholesale issue of paper money would depreciate the currency. Major
Douglas proposes to guard against this by the fixation of prices. To
which I answer that if this measure were to be effective, prices would
have to be fixed simultaneously for all commodities in all industries,
since if the scheme were applied gradually and prices fixed below cost
in one industry and not in the others the prices of commodities that
were unfixed would rise to restore the balance. But to fix prices
simultaneously in all industries is impossible, for in these days of
international markets the unit to be considered is not this country, but
the world. Under such circumstances the proposition is unthinkable. It
is the <em>reductio ad absurdum</em> of our economic system. I have
advocated fixed prices (but not selling below cost), but I recognize
clearly that a system of fixed prices could only be introduced
gradually, and it seems to me that any scheme to be practical must be
based upon that assumption.</p>
<p>The truth is Major Douglas has confused cause and effect. He sees
that the operations of industry to-day are governed by the credit
facilities in the control of the banks, and so he concludes that the
whole problem is that of credit—or if that is not entirely true, it is
true to say that he thinks the problem of credit is capable of a
separate and detached solution. It will clear the air to say that the
problem of credit is not the central but the last phase of the disease
It is the dilemma in which a civilization based upon usury finds itself
at the finish. It makes its appearance because the limit of usury has
been reached. And it is because of this that the problem is not to be
resolved finally in the terms of accountancy, but of morals. For
centuries the desire for profits has been the driving force in industry.
It has been behind our industrial developments and brought into
existence our vast complicated civilization. Nowadays the limits of this
development have been reached because the limits of compound interest
have been reached, and the centralizing process is complete. Recognizing
the fundamental nature of this problem, it is vain to suppose that a
solution can be found for this misdirection of activities merely by a
re-shuffling of the cards, which is what Major Douglas’s scheme amounts
to. On the contrary, the only thing that can lift us out of the economic
morass into which we have fallen is finally the discovery of a new
principle, the emergence of a new motive, a new driving force. The
experience of history teaches us that there is finally only one power in
this universe capable of supplying this need and successfully
challenging this commercial spirit, and that is religion. To be more
precise—Christianity, and Christianity as it was understood by the Early
Christians who attacked the ideal of wealth and property as vigorously
as any Socialist. It was Christianity that re-created civilization after
it had been disintegrated by the capitalism of Greece and Rome, and if
our civilization is to survive, it will be due to the re-emergence of
this same spirit.</p>
<p>But it will be said that if we are to wait until a revival of
Christianity is accomplished we are lost, for it is impossible to expect
wholesale conversions while the problem confronting us develops with
such rapidity. To which I answer that I am speaking of the ultimate
solution; not of immediate measures. But it would clarify our thinking
enormously about immediate practical measures if we considered them in
the light of the teachings of Christianity instead of the materialist
philosophy. No one who thought clearly in the terms of Christianity
could ever fall into the credit or Bolshevik heresies because he would
not think in the terms of Industrialism. And he would not think in the
terms of Industrialism because he would realize its central principle
was a denial of everything that Christianity stands for: “Take no
thought saying, What shall we eat? or, What shall we drink? or,
Wherewithal shall we be clothed? (for after all these things do the
Gentiles seek:) for your heavenly Father knoweth that ye have need of
all these things. But seek ye first the kingdom of God, and his
righteousness; and all these things shall be added unto you.” This is
the method of Christianity. But Industrialism is the organization of
society on the opposite assumption. Seek ye first material prosperity,
and all other things shall be added unto you it says. But experience
proves not only that they are not added, but in the long run the
material things themselves which have been so anxiously sought are taken
away.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, let us accept the fact that the day of our industrial
supremacy is over, and that we cannot hope any longer to export such
vast quantities of goods to distant markets as hitherto. As our
industries will not be able to give employment to such vast numbers of
workers, agriculture must be revived to provide at the same time work
for the unemployed, and the food we shall in the future be unable to
obtain unless we produce it for ourselves. This will necessitate a
drastic land policy. It is a matter of life and death to us, and no
vested interests must be allowed to stand in the way, any more than they
were allowed to stand in the way of the conduct of the war. Men must be
trained in agriculture and planted on the land with their families. And
they must be organized in groups under Agricultural Guilds.</p>
<p>As it is improbable, even with agriculture revived and England
colonized, for work to be provided for more than a part of our
unemployed, we must be prepared for emigration on a vast scale. Here
again organization must be in groups. We must in fact plant new
societies as the Greeks did when they colonized. There must be
agriculturalists, craftsmen, doctors and others necessary to fulfil the
various needs of these communities.</p>
<p>In order that our colonies may absorb our surplus population the
individualistic commercial philosophy which has dominated life must be
abandoned and a return made to those old principles of organization and
fair dealing which are crystallized for us in the idea of the Guilds and
the Just Price. The popularization of these ideas should accompany all
efforts of reform, for they are the two poles, as it were, of sanity in
social arrangements.</p>
<p>Then the handicrafts must be revived and machinery controlled,
otherwise the problems which perplex us will speedily reappear in these
new centres. It is possible that in the future machinery may turn out to
be a blessing instead of the curse which it is to-day. But if its course
is to be turned from destruction to construction we shall need to think
about it intelligently, and the first sign of grace in this direction
will be a determination to control it. Once the principle were admitted
its practical application would not be difficult. It could be gradually
brought under control by taxing its use where it was socially
undesirable. In other directions its use might be prohibited entirely.
Where questions of foreign trade were involved agreement would have to
be reached with other countries.</p>
<p>The measures I have enumerated are the things most fundamental. They
would become the first practical steps towards the creation of the new
world order. Though the unemployed problem is at the moment a great
perplexity to us, its appearance is a necessary circumstance in the
transition to a better order. Henceforth politics will orientate
themselves around the problem of the unemployed, and the association of
the unemployed problem with social reconstruction should convert
idealism into the terms of practical politics. For just consider what a
fundamental change of attitude this unemployed problem may bring about.
Hitherto it has been the custom in all questions of policy to put the
material factor first and to let the human factor shift for itself as
best it could—to put the interests of capital before the interests of
life. Henceforth this order will be reversed. The urgency of the
unemployed problem will compel us to give human considerations the first
place, and it must continue to do so. This of itself will effect an
intellectual revolution. Political science, which in modern times has
been literally upside down, inasmuch as it put the last things first,
should develop into a real science of human affairs.</p>
<p>Whether, however, these plans are to be realized or not, all depends
on the attitude of the next two or three years. Afterwards it will be
too late. Unless the present extraordinary spirit of apathy can be
shaken and drastic action taken to deal with the situation, it is to be
feared we shall drift into a state of anarchy, lawlessness and wild
revolt from which there can be no appeal except to force. The danger is
that instead of getting to work to lay the foundation of the new social
order, of building the new system while the old one is falling to
pieces, we may, encouraged by some brief revival of trade, deceive
ourselves into believing that there is no need of fundamental change, or
waste our time in discussing all kinds of secondary issues—things
against which we are for the most part powerless, inasmuch as they are
symptomatic of the break-up of the old order—all kinds of temporary
measures, excessive Government expenditure, high prices, high wages,
diminished output, etc., anything in fact except the real central issues
upon which our whole future depends. Then nothing will get done until it
is too late, and starvation becomes chronic among us, and Bolshevism as
the scourge of God comes upon us. If Bolshevism does come here we shall
have deserved it. For we are in an infinitely better position to face
the problems that the war has left than the Continental nations, for not
only is our rate of exchange better, but we are an Empire with vast
empty spaces ready to take our surplus population. One thing alone can
defeat us, and that is <strong>Apathy</strong>.</p>

<h2>I</h2>
<p>To-day the rates of exchange on London are:</p>
<blockquote>
<p> New York, 3.45⅛-3.45¼ (15s. 7d to the £).</p>
<p>Berlin, 256-257 (mark about of ⅞ of 1d.).</p>
<p>Paris, 58.75-58.80 (franc about 4d.).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The evidence, on which rests the arguments of these articles, is
found in the London rates of exchange current since the Armistice. Thus
it will be advisable to give a few of the outstanding rates.</p>
<p>In the case of the United States the par of exchange is $4.8665 to
the £; on December 5, 1918, the rate was $4.770; while on November 20,
1920, the rate was $3.470. The rates for the Argentine were 5.040 pesos
to the £ (parity), 4.665 (December 5, 1918), and 4.582 (November 20,
1920). For Japan the corresponding figures are 9.800, 8.972 and 6.857
yen to the £.</p>
<p>Thus it will be seen that the rates between London and the two great
industrial nations of the East and of the West have moved considerably
in a direction adverse to London. In other words, the dollar is now
40.2%, and the yen 42.9% above their par value.</p>
<p>In the case of the Argentine, the movement is not so pronounced, and
the peso is only 10%, above its par value. Still, this is sufficiently
disquieting when one remembers the foodstuffs that we are in the habit
of buying from that country.</p>
<p>Returning to Europe, there are only two countries whose London rates
of exchange are above par. These are Holland and Switzerland, both small
nations that remained neutral while the tide of war swept round them.
The Dutch florin on November 11, 1920, was 6.3%, and the Swiss franc
13.7%, above their par values, the actual rates being 11.39 florins and
22.19 francs respectively.</p>
<p>The remaining neutral nations of Europe are now at or below
par—Sweden exactly at par, Norway and Denmark 29.7%, Spain 4.5%. But
when we consider our late allies, and enemies, we find as we progress
eastwards the position getting worse and worse. On November 11th, two
years after the Armistice, the franc in Paris was 56.2%, below its par
value, the Italian lira 72.6%, the Portuguese escudo 85.8%, the German
mark 91.9%, the Bohemian kroner 91.4%, the Austrian kroner 97.9%, and
the Polish mark 98.6%.</p>
<p>Now let us understand these percentages. Remember that a depreciation
of 100%, means that a currency is worth literally nothing for exchange
purposes. Then we can see how near the currencies of Europe are
approaching to this absolute zero.</p>
<p>Now what is the meaning of this? And how does it affect you and me?
And what is the future of Europe? Before we can answer these grave
questions we must understand the economic structure of Europe as it
existed before the war.</p>
<p>The present industrial system is of recent growth. It was only at the
close of the eighteenth century that the ingenuity of man devised means
by which the processes of manufacture could be carried out by power
instead of hand labour. It is only during the last century that the
physicist and the chemist entered into our industrial life.</p>
<p>The results of the “industrial revolution” were far-reaching. It was
directly responsible for the modern factory system, which gathered the
peoples into large towns and enabled the industrial countries of Europe
to maintain a vastly increased population. In fact, one can say that if
the present industrial system were destroyed half the population of
Europe must either emigrate or starve.</p>
<p>The system by which Europe lived in pre-war days may be described
very shortly. Europe imported her food and raw materials from overseas
and exported, in exchange, the products manufactured from the raw
materials she had imported the year before. These products were of
greater value than the raw materials owing to the skill and labour
Europe put into them, and on this difference Europe lived.</p>
<p>This is a rough outline of the system, but it needs several
qualifications. In the first place, the difference in value mentioned
above was greater than Europe’s actual needs. This difference was
invested by Europe either in home or overseas industries. This capital,
in turn, helped to create more wealth. Thus the European shareholders
received additional payments from abroad in the shape of interest.</p>
<p>Secondly, Europe rendered many services to the rest of the world; her
vessels carried American and Japanese goods, her merchants dealt in
them, her banks financed the movements of these goods, and her insurance
companies protected them. All these services were paid for and the
payment, like the interest, came in the form of goods—chiefly food and
raw materials.</p>
<p>The essence of this system was exchange. We gave our finished
products and our services in exchange for our food and raw materials.
And the lever that operated this system was called the Bill of
Exchange.</p>
<p>A Bill of Exchange is, in simple words, a statement of claim by a
creditor on his debtor. Now an American creditor needs payment in
dollars, and a British creditor in sterling, a Frenchman in francs. The
weight of gold in a sovereign, a 10 dollar piece, etc., is fixed by each
country’s laws.</p>
<p>Thus the gold exchange value between sovereigns and dollars can be
easily calculated, and this is called the par of exchange. So it is
normally open to the debtor to send gold in payment to his creditor. But
the actual shipment of gold involves expense, so he usually adopted the
second method.</p>
<p>This method is for him to find a creditor in his own country who will
sell him a Bill of Exchange or claim upon a debtor in the country to
which he himself owes money, or in other words, an Englishman importing
cotton from America has to buy dollars with which to pay for his cotton:
for the American exporter, as a rule, needs payment in his own
currency.</p>
<p>Similarly an American buying goods from England has to buy sterling,
so he gets in touch with the Englishman who wishes to buy dollars, and
the transaction is arranged to their mutual advantage. But if England
has imported more than she has exported, there will be several
Englishmen trying to buy dollars for each American who wishes to sell
dollars for sterling. So the price of dollars rises—for the demand
exceeds the supply.</p>
<p>In other words, the rate of exchange will move against England.
Normally this movement will have a limit, for English debtors will find
it cheaper to ship gold. But if we have prohibited the export of gold,
or if we have a paper currency which can be expanded at will, then, as
we see to-day, there is no automatic check to the amount an exchange may
depreciate.</p>
<p>It must be remembered that an expansion of currency means a rise in
prices, and the price of foreign bills or foreign currency is not exempt
from this law. Again, a paper currency brings Gresham’s law into
operation, and drives the gold out of circulation. Thus there is no gold
available which can be used for payment of foreign debts, and the
importers in that country are forced to pay inflated prices for their
foreign bills.</p>
<p>We have now described the system by which Europe lived before the
war. We see that it depended on a cycle of exchange, and that the cycle
was operated by the bill of exchange, and the value of the bill of
exchange was maintained, if necessary, by gold shipments. We see that an
unsound currency destroys that safeguard, and thus strikes a heavy blow
at the system on which Europe lived.</p>
<p>The next point to consider is the effect of the war. During the four
years of war every effort of the various belligerents was directed
towards their mutual destruction. Thus in England the Government took
control of the industries of the country and directed their energies to
the manufacture of munitions, which were used, not only to destroy
themselves, but also the products and factories of pre-war industry. The
effect of this was to reduce the country’s exports to a minimum, while
the imports of raw materials for munitions increased enormously. The
same applied to all the Allies, and the effect was to pile up an
enormous debt owed by the Allies to America.</p>
<p>To liquidate this debt, the Allies were forced in the first place to
sell their overseas investments. This entailed the loss of the interest
Europe had been receiving from overseas. Later on the Allies in turn
were forced to borrow money from overseas.</p>
<p>Thus, in addition to the loss of her former interest, Europe
henceforward had to pay interest abroad. This meant that to preserve the
trade balance Europe ought to increase her exports at a time when all
her energies were absorbed in the war.</p>
<p>Again, before the war, Europe paid for many of her imports by
rendering services to the world. But in time of war she was unable to
render these services, and so lost another source of payment. Since the
war this has been partially recovered. But the Mercantile Marine of
Europe has not yet recovered from its war losses. Moreover, there has
been a noticeable increase in the shipping owned by the rest of the
world. Similarly, the banking and merchant system had been thoroughly
disorganized.</p>
<p>Finally, every belligerent had to find the money necessary for the
prosecution of the war. This was done in the first place by means of
taxes and long-term loans. These absorbed the surplus income and the
savings of the various countries, and so diverted them from their normal
purpose of developing the economic life of Europe, and turned them to
the purposes of war and destruction. But no country wholly paid for the
war by these means, and so the deficit had to be met by an increase in
their “floating debt.”</p>
<p>The effect of a large floating debt, in its best form, is to absorb
all the ready money of the country, which normally is put to a
productive use; in its worst form a large floating debt leads to
inflation of the credit and the currency of a nation. By inflation is
meant the artificial creation of fresh purchasing power without a
corresponding supply of commodities which can absorb this purchasing
power. Thus the prices of commodities rise, and with them the price of
foreign currencies. Or in other words, the foreign exchanges of the
belligerents were depreciated as a result of inflation.</p>
<p>Thus the effect of the war was to shatter in every possible way the
cycle of trade which upheld the pre-war economic structure of Europe. It
dammed the pre-war flow of exports from Europe. It reversed the pre-war
flow of interest which formerly paid for some of Europe’s imports. It
disorganized the means Europe had of rendering services to the world. It
used up and destroyed the stocks of raw materials which Europe
possessed. And finally it artificially inflated the currency and credit
of Europe, and by depreciating her exchanges rendered it even more
difficult for her to obtain those raw materials she needed to restart
her flow of exports. The cycle has been broken, and it remains an open
question whether it can be repaired.</p>
</section>
<section id="ii" class="level2">
<h2>II</h2>
<p>WE have seen that the effect of the war was to make Europe break
every law upon which her economic structure rested. The position at the
Armistice was tragically simple, but most of us were too blind to see
it.</p>
<p>Briefly, Europe was swept bare of raw materials, and had no finished
products with which to buy them. Her overseas investments had been sold
and, in addition, money had been borrowed from abroad with which to pay
for the war. Her commercial and financial system was shattered, and her
mercantile marine crippled by the submarine campaign. All her savings,
all her energy, had been directed to the purposes of destruction.</p>
<p>There was very little left with which to re-start the industries on
which her very life depended. All she possessed was large quantities of
paper money, which were more or less useless for the purpose of
replenishing her stocks of raw material.</p>
<p>Even so, the full story has not yet been told. The war’s toll in life
and suffering must still be reckoned in the account. Even those who
returned unharmed found that they had lost their habits of regular work.
Again, no account has been taken of the actual destruction that the war
was the cause of—the farm-lands of the Somme, and the coal-mines of
Lens.</p>
<p>Above all, we must add in the loss caused by the collapse of Russia,
which was the granary of Europe. If we total up all these items, we see
how great was the danger facing us at the conclusion of the war.</p>
<p>It may be urged that Europe recovered from the Napoleonic wars a
century ago. This is true, but it should be remembered that our
industrial system was still in its infancy. Practically every country
was still self-supporting, and had a far smaller population to maintain.
At that date Europe was still mainly agricultural, and the different
countries were not then bound together into the component parts of one
huge machine.</p>
<p>But if the facts in 1918-19 were as we have stated them, what steps
were taken at the Peace Conference to save Europe from the effects of
the war? To speak quite frankly, the Peace Conference hardly recognized
their existence.</p>
<p>Thus they discussed the possibilities of obtaining indemnities from
Germany. They did not realize that the only possible way was to take
over all German industries, supply them with raw materials, and the
people with food, and run them as a “going concern” for what they could
get by way of profit. This might have been brutal, but the German people
would have been properly fed.</p>
<p>Again, under the name of self-determination, the old Austrian Empire
was dismembered. The new States that arose out of it promptly erected
customs barriers one against the other, thus failing to realize that
they could only exist if they looked upon themselves as one economic
unit. The result is now too obvious namely, that a state of financial
and economic chaos has given rise to a state of destitution and
starvation.</p>
<p>Finally, as a result of the Peace Treaties the Allies have been left
with huge military commitments all over the world at a time when every
penny was needed to re-start the industrial machine. It is clear now
what should have been done. It should have been seen that the restarting
of European industries was a race against time, and that compared to
this nothing else was of the slightest importance. Food, materials and
labour should have been sent at once to where they were needed, and no
effort should have been spared to ensure that this was done.</p>
<p>Instead of this petty quarrels have broken out in Fiume, in Poland,
in Asia Minor, in Mesopotamia, and, in fact, all over the world. These
have all involved expense, and forced the Governments of Europe to
resort to further inflation. No Government is guiltless, and least of
all the Peace Conference.</p>
<p>The result of this is seen in the exchange movements that have taken
place since the Armistice. They show us the result of national
extravagance, especially of our military adventures. At this season of
the year Europe has to purchase the world’s crops of wheat, cotton,
etc., without which she cannot exist. She has nothing with which to pay
for them, except a few manufactured products and paper money.</p>
<p>The value that the world attaches to this paper money is shown by the
present rates of exchange. Compare, too, the present rates with those
current a year ago, when Europe was purchasing last year’s crops, and it
ill be clear that Europe is slowly sinking under the burden that the war
placed on her shoulders.</p>
<p>Thus, in December 1919 our pound was worth 3 dollars 8 1 cents in New
York; in November 1920 only 3 dollars 44 cents. In December 1919 our
pound would buy 41.03 francs, 49.63 lire, and 181.53 marks (contrast
even these rates with the par of exchange). In November 1920 these rates
were 57.17 francs, 95.13 lire, and 262.89 marks. This shows the extent
to which the dry rot has spread during the year.</p>
<p>The cause of this rot is plain—Europe must buy in order to live, but
she has nothing to sell. And unless the cycle of trade is restarted, she
will still have nothing to sell.</p>
<p>It may be asked: “What steps have the Governments taken in order to
rectify this position?” The answer is that most steps taken by the
Governments have resulted in aggravating the position.</p>
<p>There is no need to call attention to the extravagance of the various
Governments. The word is on every one’s lips, and the pity is that
people do not realize the direction in which extravagance is leading us.
For every fresh load of debt, every fresh issue of paper money brings
the final tragedy nearer—when the machine on which we depend, and which
is already tottering under the blows dealt it by the war, will be unable
to serve us any longer.</p>
<p>It is easy to give examples of the results of this
extravagance—Continental inflation and British E.P.D. The first renders
it more and more impossible for the Continent to buy, the second renders
it difficult for our industries to produce the goods the Continent needs
at a price they can pay. But whatever it results in, one thing is clear:
This extravagance must cease, if Europe is to be saved.</p>
<p>Among other steps taken, various Governments have attempted to
regulate their exchanges. This was done during the war with fair
success; but it meant the loss of our overseas securities, and also the
raising of foreign loans. But after the war the exchanges had to be left
to find their own level, with the result we now see.</p>
<p>Sporadic attempts, however, have been made to arrest their fall. The
fall in sterling was arrested temporarily by the shipment of gold last
March to New York, and by reduction in purchases. A month later France
arrested the fall of the franc by a very drastic series of import
restrictions. That they were only partly successful was probably due to
further Government extravagance.</p>
<p>The Portuguese Government tried to fix their exchanges by an
arbitrary decree, but found that the only result was to cut off their
imports. Lastly, our own attempts to regulate the currency in India and
East Africa have met with a large amount of justifiable criticism.</p>
<p>Any attempt of this kind is bound to fail, for the rates of exchange
are but a symptom of the economic illness from which a country is
suffering. It is useless to remove the symptom without removing the
cause of the illness, and so it is useless to regulate a rate of
exchange while leaving the cause of its depreciation untouched.</p>
<p>If any further evidence is needed of the breakdown of the economic
machine, it is found in the wild price fluctuations that have been
rampant during the past two years. It is comparatively easy to trace
these price movements and also their causes. The Armistice found Europe
swept bare of all her stocks of goods. Her industries were all mobilized
for the production of munitions, while her peoples had an
ever-increasing supply of paper money in their pockets.</p>
<p>As industry resumed a peace footing, orders flowed in from all over
the world, and every factory was filled up with orders for months ahead.
It is no wonder that prices began to soar, while speculation was
rampant, and huge profits became the rule. Nor is it surprising that the
workers claimed a share in these profits, and a better wage with which
to meet the rise in prices.</p>
<p>Disastrous strikes followed until these higher wages were granted,
and the mere granting of them entailed a rise in production costs, which
forced the manufacturer to maintain his swollen prices. Nor can the
Governments be absolved from profiteering. The British Government
enforced a Profiteering Act at home, while they were selling coal at £10
per ton on the Continent.</p>
<p>The effect of these high prices quickly showed itself in the rates of
exchange, and by the middle of this year the Continental exchanges had
depreciated so badly that Europe was unable to buy our goods. Then the
break came, and prices began to fall. This fall brought with it
dwindling profits, in some cases enforced liquidation, and in most
trades unemployment for the workers. The boom in British trade was
broken, and the slump is only now beginning.</p>
<p>This is the position to-day. Europe is dying for lack of our goods,
but Europe cannot produce the goods she needs in order to pay for ours.
For we cannot take payment in paper money and depreciated currencies. So
our export trade is going, our industries are being slowly strangled,
and our men are being thrown out of work. That is what the collapse of
Europe means to us, and now we can only see the beginning. Remember that
as we go eastward from the Bay of Biscay the exchanges become worse and
worse until we reach Russia, where the rouble is absolutely worthless.
Watch the rates of exchange, and then ask yourself, “What will be the
end?”</p>

<h2>III</h2>
<p>We have seen that before the war Europe supported a larger population
than she could have fed from her own produce by exporting finished
goods, by the interest on her overseas loans and the payment for her
services.</p>
<p>The war has decreased or destroyed the last two sources of income and
replaced them by claims for interest on war loans, which means that
henceforth she must export more than she imports instead of being able
to do the reverse as she did in 1913.</p>
<p>Moreover, the supply of finished goods with which she bought next
year’s food and raw materials no longer exists. Unless, however, she can
get these essentials she cannot restart her industrial system, and
having no goods to give she can only offer paper money. This being only
of use if foreigners can exchange it for goods, has continued to
depreciate steadily since peace was made, as there are not the
goods.</p>
<p>In short, the position, after two years’ peace, is, as shown by the
rates of exchange, far worse than in 1918. Therefore, Europe is slowly
drifting into a state of bankruptcy, which means that ultimately she
will no longer be able to buy the bare necessities of life. When that
happens the whole system must collapse. What that means is shown by the
condition of affairs in Russia, a country, which, being mainly
agricultural, should have been able to feed itself if any European
country could.</p>
<p>The possibility of such a catastrophe is so terrible that so far no
one has dared to suggest it, but the writers feel that unless people
realize where they are drifting no efforts to avert it will be made till
it is too late. They do not say that even now it is impossible to save
Europe, though it will be no easy task, but they do say, if things are
allowed to drift for another two or three years it will be too late
then. It is certainly possible to save Great Britain to-day; by then it
may be too late.</p>
<p>Unfortunately there are not wanting other indications that our
civilization is in danger. We can only tabulate these briefly, but
whenever in history a civilization has been approaching its end similar
indications have appeared.</p>
<p>They include a marked laxity in the morals and an open challenge to
the established moral codes. For example, “The Right to Motherhood”
shows what is meant. The failing influence of the orthodox faiths, love
of luxury and extravagance at a time when tens of thousands are
suffering from want; a spirit of lawless violence, coupled with a
strange apathy on the part of a large section of the community, are
characteristic indications of a decaying civilization.</p>
<p>Though these vices are noticeable in Great Britain to-day, they are
not nearly so marked as in many Continental countries, and only
emphasize the more the fact that Great Britain is still healthier than
the Continent.</p>
<p>As the situation on the Continent goes from bad to worse, we find it
increasingly difficult to sell our goods. We, above all countries, are
dependent on our export trade, and it is poor consolation for us to know
that America is suffering in proportion, even more severely in her
export trade, from the same cause. America can feed herself still,
whereas we cannot. To her, external trade is almost a luxury, to us it
is an absolute necessity. Without it, half our population will
starve.</p>
<p>Already we are witnessing the gradual closing of our Continental
markets, and almost a panic among our manufacturers at the possibility
of being undersold in the home markets by the Continent, but this aspect
of the case was dealt with in the <em>Daily News</em> on November
26th.</p>
<p>Unless the decline on the Continent is stopped, this strangling of
our industries will continue, and it behoves us now to consider
seriously what we shall do in that event. There is no need for panic,
but that is far less likely than apathy and contemptuous unbelief till
the crisis is on us. By then it will be too late. Rather let us take
such a possibility into our reckoning, and begin to prepare alternative
plans.</p>
<p>If Europe can be saved, then gradually things will right themselves,
and the first thing to be done is for every Government at home or abroad
to reduce its expenditure to the very lowest that is possible, even if
this entails the abandonment of desirable social schemes or valuable
military positions. We simply cannot afford them.</p>
<p>Every country must not merely increase production, but see that the
goods made are exchanged for the things they must have. It is no use
filling warehouses with goods which our neighbours cannot buy because
their exchanges are so badly depreciated. We in Great Britain must open
up new markets, if necessary, by means of barter, particularly with
countries other than the United States of America, from which we can get
food or raw materials—for example, Poland and Russia.</p>
<p>But supposing Europe cannot be saved, what will happen? Briefly it
will be impossible to transport the excessive millions in Europe
overseas. What will happen to them is what has happened in Russia, and
to-day is happening in Poland and Austria they will die.</p>
<p>Those who survive will revert to an agricultural race, with but
simple industries and no elaborate industrial system. Do not think that
this picture is too highly coloured. Five years ago, would you have
thought it possible that Russia would have reached the condition she is
in to-day? Russia, remember, represents one-quarter of the earth’s
surface. As we move eastward from the Bay of Biscay to the frontiers of
Russia, we find that the exchanges fall consistently. On November 30th
France was 57.80 francs to the, Italy 95.50, Germany 250, Austria 1,175,
Poland 1,750, Hungary not quoted, Russia —! And on the frontiers of
Poland gather a pack of starving men looking hungrily westward.</p>
<p>What is the alternative to the present system if it does not recover?
It is not Bolshevism. That is the last resort of desperate, starving
men. It may come when the last agony of dissolution is upon Europe, but
it cannot reorganize and feed the present large population. It has
already appeared sporadically in Hungary, Germany and Italy. It has been
driven underground—perhaps—but only for a time. If you want to prevent
Bolshevism see that the people are well fed. That, however, is just what
we are unable to do in many parts of Europe. The machine that did is
broken by the war, it is still freely rotating, but each month it moves
slower and with more difficulty.</p>
<p>If we cannot save Europe, can we at least save ourselves?</p>
<p>Yes! if we prepare in time, Great Britain can be saved, but it will
not be the Great Britain we knew and loved before the war. With our
Continental markets gone, and our export trade crippled, we shall not be
able to support our present population.</p>
<p>A drastic land policy would settle on the countryside millions who
are now congregated into industrial areas. Millions would have to
emigrate to our Overseas Dominions and Colonies. Herein lies our
strength. We are an Empire with vast empty spaces, with lands which can
produce the food and raw materials we shall still need, and supply us
with the simple things of life, which we can barter with the more
primitive peoples of Europe.</p>
<p>Our industries will dwindle, but our geographical position will
enable us to remain a great seafaring and merchant race. As the last
outpost of the industrial west (by then the United States of America) we
can still carry the merchandise of those countries which cluster round
the Pacific to those who dwell in Russia and barter them for the
minerals and raw materials they are prepared to offer.</p>
<p>But it will be a smaller England with probably less than half its
present population and perhaps a humbler member of the British Empire
than it is to-day. Do not let us suppose that we can continue
indefinitely to export huge quantities of manufactured goods to
Australia, Canada, or even South Africa. During the war these countries
have been developing their own manufactures near the spot where they
produce raw materials. This process is bound to continue.</p>
<p>Has it ever struck you how the centre of industry, commerce and
civilization has shifted ever westward? In classical days the
Mediterranean was the centre, in the Middle Ages it was the Baltic,
where the Hanseatic League ruled. In the sixteenth century it shifted to
the Atlantic. What if it is again moving to the Pacific, where America
and Australia face China and Japan? Look at the rates of exchange of
Japan and the United States of America if this possibility seems
fantastic.</p>
<p>But it takes time to move millions of men, and if the industrial
system is breaking down, what will take its place? State Socialism
cannot, for it presupposes a huge industrial machine. Perhaps the Guild
Socialists have seen a vision of the ultimate solution, but, if so, they
must descend from the clouds and begin to construct their system here
and now.</p>
<p>It is useless to imagine our Guildsman will straightaway become a
saint. He will be exactly the same man who at present forms part of the
industrial system. In time a better system may produce more perfect men,
but they must evolve by degrees.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the wise man uses the material he has to hand, and in
truth the average Briton, despite his faults, is still the cream of the
earth. In short, why not begin to build the new system to-day, so that
it is a running machine by the time the old one breaks down completely?
But still, perhaps, this appears a nightmare dream. What if, after all,
it is but the darkness before the dawn of better things? Nightmare or
vision of the dawn, take your choice, but look at the writing on the
wall and ask which country follows Russia, and the answer is given to
you by <em>the rates of Exchange</em>.</p>
