<h1>I. Socialism and Christianity</h1>
<p>If the position be granted that is assumed by nearly all reformers,
that the salvation of society involves among other things its
reorganisation on some corporate or co-operative basis, there are two
ways in which the problem of reconstruction may be approached. The first
of these is the Christian one which, taking its stand on the permanent
needs of human nature, assumes the existence of a type of society which
may be designated as the normal, because it most perfectly satisfies
human needs, and therefore directs its policy towards the recovery and
strengthening of everything in life and society that is to be regarded
as normal. The other, which is the Socialist one, is altogether
destitute of any conception of normality, since, apart from the
elementary needs of food, clothing, and shelter, it treats other human
needs as non-essentials, subject to change and flux. It takes its stand
on the supposed truth of a theory of social evolution according to which
all social phenomena are to be regarded as relative, and human nature
capable of infinite adaptation to changing circumstances. Its policy is
therefore not directed towards a return to the normal, but towards the
stabilisation of the abnormal. All thought on social questions moves
between these opposed conceptions, which have their roots finally in the
teachings of Christ and of Marx, and the reason why there is so much
confusion of thought on social questions is that most people, whether
they be Socialists, Labourists or Christians, fail to discriminate
between the categories, vainly imagining they can compromise between the
two.</p>
<p>This, however, is finally impossible, as all sooner or later must
find out; for all such compromises are in the long run rendered
untenable by the course of events, and one conception must eventually
triumph over the other. As to which it will be, there should nowadays be
no room for doubt; for if experience of attempts at social
reconstruction can be held to prove anything, it is the inadequacy of
the Socialist approach. Before the War, Socialist legislation on
Collectivist lines was enacted under the auspices of the Liberal
Government, the most notable example being that of the Insurance Act,
which produced very different results from what was expected. For
instead of bringing to the workers a larger measure of freedom, it
resulted in their regimentation. It was seen that in so far as it
increased the security of the workers it was at the expense of their
liberty; for the tendency of all such legislation is towards a condition
of things which Mr. Belloc aptly described as the “servile state.” Yet
so far as the majority of Socialists were concerned, this experience of
the working of their theories was either entirely wasted on them or it
resulted in a reaction against the moderation of Fabian policy—towards
the more revolutionary attitude of Marx, syndicalism, and direct
action—it being maintained by the extremists that the failure of all
such legislation was due to the mistake of attempting to introduce
Socialist legislation before capitalism was overthrown and
abolished.</p>
<p>The Russian Revolution afforded an opportunity of testing the truth
of this assertion. But far from succeeding in their efforts to abolish
capitalism and establish Socialism or communism in its place, the
Bolsheviks found themselves finally compelled by the force of
circumstances to open the door for the re-entry of foreign capitalists
into Russia, without whose aid Lenin had to confess they could not get
along. And this failure, it is to be observed, can in no sense be
ascribed to the opposition of foreign powers, to which Socialists in
this country like to ascribe it, but was inherent in their policy from
the start. For when the Bolsheviks abolished private property they
committed economic suicide, because henceforth it was impossible for
them to raise revenue by taxation, and as their Government had to have
money to keep going it was driven to support its existence by means of
the printing press. The wholesale issue of paper money which resulted
had the effect of depreciating the currency to an extent hitherto
undreamed of, for the paper money they issued fell and fell in value
until finally notes were worth no more than the value of the paper they
were printed on. It was the opinion of Lenin at that time that by such
means currency could be abolished, private trading and profiteering
brought to an end, and communism established. But it did not work out as
expected, since in proportion as currency lost its value the result was
not communism but stagnation, to combat which the Bolsheviks were driven
to resort to labour conscription, in fact to introduce that very
regimentation which Socialists had maintained was the consequence of
attempting to introduce Socialism before capitalism was abolished. We
see therefore that it matters not whether Socialist measures are
promoted by moderates or extremists, under a capitalist Government or by
a Socialist one, they result in the enslavement of the industrial
workers; while paradoxically it has happened that the only class who
promise to benefit by the revolution in Russia is the peasantry, for the
only reform introduced by the Bolsheviks that appears likely to remain
is the nationalisation of the land.</p>
<p>The experience of Germany and Italy is not more reassuring. After the
Revolution in Germany the Socialists found themselves in power. But when
they got it they did not know what to do with it. All their lives they
had talked about the nationalisation of land, capital, and the means of
production and exchange, but their accession to power revealed their
impotence. After fifty years of general oratory they had no constructive
scheme to give practical effect to their theories, and so it came about
that they were driven to make terms with the capitalists to carry on. In
Italy, the Socialists took possession of the factories and the peasants
of the land, while the Government adopted a neutral attitude, acting as
arbitrator between the workers and the capitalists. But the unemployed
problem which had led to the piecemeal revolution not only remained but
increased under the new regime, and it was not long before the
Socialists were prepared to allow the capitalists to resume possession
of the factories, though the peasants have kept hold of the land.
Meanwhile the Revolution created a nationalist reaction, giving rise to
Fascism, which, after having by its violent methods reduced the
Socialist elements to silence and taken possession of the Government,
has changed its attitude, adopting a friendly attitude towards Labour,
setting its face against profiteers, and, under the influence of
d’Annunzio, whose prestige in Italy is unprecedented, gone a long way
towards adopting a Guild platform.</p>
<p>One would have thought that such a series of reverses would have
shaken the faith of the most ardent Socialist in the sufficiency of his
creed. Yet if the utterances of the official leaders in this country can
be taken as an index of the mind of the movement, no change at all has
taken place. In their latest book<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> Mr. and Mrs. Sidney Webb
still believe in the old nostrums. Mr. Philip Snowden’s great speech in
the House of Commons on the “Failure of Capitalist Civilisation”<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> was orthodox collectivism. It threw
not a particle of light on any practical problem confronting the
country. For while it is undoubtedly true that capitalist civilisation
has failed, it is equally true that the Socialist remedy has failed; for
Socialist measures fail entirely to get at grips with the actual
situation, which doubtless explains the fact that Sir Alfred Mond was
able to make out about as good a case for the retention of capitalism as
Mr. Philip Snowden was for its abolition.</p>

<p>The immediate reason for this failure is doubtless to be found in the
fact that in attempting to abolish the institutions of private
management and property, except in regard to land and natural
monopolies, the Socialist movement is at war with the very nature of
things. I shall have something to say about the practical failure of
Socialist theories in later chapters. But for the present I am only
concerned with the more general and philosophic cause of failure, which
I submit is to be found in this: that there is no correspondence between
the moral impulse of the Socialist movement and its official economic
theories; nay, so far from there being any correspondence, they are
actually contradictory, and to this fact the practical failure of
Socialist measures is to be ascribed. To understand the Socialist
movement, it must be realised that it is primarily a moral revolt. The
movement draws its recruits from among those who are outraged by the
corruption and injustices of our industrial system, and if we are to see
the movement in its proper perspective this fact must never be
forgotten. Its great achievement is to have given to the world a social
conscience. If we compare the state of mind a hundred years ago,
portrayed so vividly in the books of the Hammonds on the period covered
by the Industrial Revolution, the callous, inhuman, and hypocritical
attitude of the rich towards the sufferings and misfortunes of the poor,
and the prevailing hard, mechanical outlook on life and society with the
attitude which obtains to-day, the change of outlook and feeling is
astonishing, amounting to no less than a revolution. And though we must
not forget the many writers—Carlyle, Ruskin, Disraeli, Dickens, Charles
Reade, Kingsley—who by their writings directed public attention to the
great injustices of our social system, I yet think the great change that
has taken place is in the main due to the activities of Socialists,
whose absolute devotion and untiring energy in the cause of the
oppressed has made the social problem a living issue in politics. An
indirect consequence of their activity has been that the need of social
change, of replacing our existing competitive society by one based upon
the principles of brotherhood, mutual aid, and co-operation, has become
widely accepted by people entirely unaffected by Socialist theories,
thus providing us with a foundation upon which it is possible to build.
But the official economic theories of Socialism have no connection
whatsoever with any reaction or revolt against capitalism, nor with the
principles of brotherhood and co-operation. On the contrary, they accept
capitalism as a stage in social and economic evolution in the hope of
superimposing over it a communal organisation, failing entirely to
understand that Socialist figs cannot be made to grow on capitalist
thistles. It is this discrepancy, not to say contradiction, between the
head and the heart of Socialism, between its economic theories and moral
intention, that brings to naught all their efforts at reconstruction,
for their theories when translated into practice produce results not
intended by their authors.</p>
<p>Recognising then that the failure of Socialist measures is to be
found in the fact that the economic theories of the movement do not
correspond with its moral intention, the problem which confronts us is
how to replace the existing economic theory of Socialism by one that
does correspond. This carries us into very deep waters, for it involves
finally nothing less than the repudiation of the materialist philosophy
that lies at the back of the movement and a frank acceptance of the
principles of Christianity; for all the great sociological principles
are implicit in the Gospels and to them we must return if we are to
build on a safe and sure foundation. Yet great as is the change that is
demanded, it is one that is in harmony with the trend of modern thought
on social questions, the centre of gravity of which is being gradually
shifted from economics to psychology, and as such is favourable to a
renewal of belief in Christianity, for it is a change from an external
to an internal approach. It was inevitable, perhaps, that the first
awakening of the social conscience should have been associated with the
external approach of Socialist theory: for the growth of understanding
of the true inwardness of the social problem has taken time to develop.
Before a true conception of anything comes to be accepted, the mind of
the world must be prepared for its reception; that is to say, there must
exist predisposing causes and influences leading men in the direction of
the new conception and tending to develop in them the faculties which
shall recognise it. In this sense the Socialist theory and agitation may
be regarded as a necessary preparation for the acceptance of the social
gospel of Christianity, since but for the concentration of thought on
social questions to which it has given rise and the failure of Socialist
experiments in social reconstruction, the Christian ideal would have
remained unacceptable.</p>
<p>But we are not out of the wood yet. When we have travelled thus far
there is a danger of falling into another pitfall, into an error the
exact opposite of that of the Socialists. When people become aware of
the inadequacy of the Socialist position and begin to realise the
sociological implications of Christianity—when they see that the social
problem is not only material and economic but spiritual and
psychological, and learn that spiritual values must come first—they are
very liable to fall into the error of withdrawing from practical
activity on the assumption that economic evils may not be attacked
direct. Such an interpretation of the message of Christianity I believe
to be entirely mistaken and to be Manichaean rather than Christian, for
the Christian injunction to put spiritual things first clearly does not
mean that we are to concentrate all our thought and energy upon the
spiritual to the neglect of the material, but that material evils can
only be remedied when they are attacked in the light of a spiritual
idea, because unless material evils are approached from a spiritual
standpoint we shall be mistaken as to the nature of the material
problem. It is difficult to make people understand exactly what is meant
by this, but an illustration will perhaps convey my meaning in a way
that abstract argument is powerless to do. When an architect designs a
house, say, he will (if he knows his job) begin by making a plan of the
roof, for he knows that the design of the roof governs both the
elevation and the internal arrangements. But the builder starts work at
the other end, and builds, not from the roof, but from the foundations.
In the same way it is necessary for us in our efforts to create a new
social order to design from the roof (spiritual values) and build from
the foundations (material problems). Unfortunately, however, very few
people understand this paradoxical nature of the position; for the world
is full of spiritually minded people who understand that it is necessary
to design from the roof but imagine they can build from the top
downwards, and practically minded people who realise that they must
build from the foundations but imagine it is possible to design from the
bottom upwards. And because of these misunderstandings most of our
discussion is at cross purposes and most of our energies run to waste,
for with such notions true co-operation is impossible. Seen in this
light the problem before us is how to dispel these illusions in the
minds of both the spiritual and the practical—how to make Christians
understand what is true in Socialism, and Socialists to understand the
truth of Christianity.</p>

<h1>II. Socialism and the Idea of Progress</h1>
<p>The underlying cause of the discrepancy between the moral impulse of
the Socialist movement and its official economic theories is to be found
in the idea of Progress, which it is necessary to understand if we are
to understand the Socialist movement or, for that matter, the modern
world. For if it be true, as Professor Bury asserts, that “the success
of the idea of Progress has been promoted by its association with
Socialism,”<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a> it is equally true to say that the
success of Socialism has been promoted by its association with the idea
of Progress. For Socialism grew up in the atmosphere of the idea of
Progress, which determined its main economic conceptions.</p>

</ol>
</section>
<p>Now on first acquaintance, Progress presents itself as the vaguest of
ideas; for it is associated with the most contradictory things. Thus it
is invoked in support of the ideal of democracy, of liberty, equality,
and fraternity, while it undoubtedly does lend support to the reaction
towards slavery. It is used in some quarters to support the idea that
the majority is always right and in others that the minority is always
right; while there are people who somehow manage to believe in both
ideas at one and the same time. It was defined by John Stuart Mill “as
the preservation of all kinds and amounts of good which already exist
and the increase of them,” which presents an idea to which no
Mediaevalist could possibly object; while in affirming that “all
progress is differentiation,” Herbert Spencer enunciated an idea to
which every Mediaevalist would very much object. And so we are left
wondering whether Progress is really an idea at all or whether it is not
entirely a superstition to which all who intend to take part in
practical activities must subscribe –a catchword which can be twisted to
mean almost anything, but which yet somehow manages to get in the way of
most things that are worth doing.</p>
<p>On the face of things such undoubtedly is the case. Yet, in spite of
the fact that the word Progress may mean almost anything, it is
nevertheless an idea with a very definite historical connotation, and a
very important one too. For its essence is to be found in this—the
assumption that the new thing is to be preferred to the old. It took
shape in the seventeenth century, and can be traced back to Francis
Bacon, who urged the necessity of a break with the past. Until the time
of Bacon, the main preoccupation of men who wished to improve the world
was the problem of how to change men. No man in the Middle Ages ever
entertained the idea that the arrival of an ideal social system could
precede the arrival of ideal men. But Bacon (who incidentally was a bit
of a rascal), living at the time of the Reformation, when the unity of
Christendom was destroyed, sought to promote the idea that as religion
and morals had failed, social salvation was not to be found in any
internal change of spirit but in external change of circumstances, and
to this end he wrote a scientific Utopia called the <em>New
Atlantis</em>, in which he looked for the happiness of mankind chiefly
to applied natural philosophy and the scientific organisation of
production. Yet it was due to the influence of Descartes rather than to
Bacon that the idea of Progress became accepted. Bacon had taken his
stand on the broad issue of science versus religion. But Descartes was
more diplomatic. He did not make the issue one between science and
religion, but between the future and the past. This attitude would have
been impossible for Bacon, since he had a certain reverence for
classical literature which would for him have made such an issue unreal.
But Descartes was not hampered by any such considerations. He was
modernist in spirit. He was proud of having forgotten the Greek he
learned as a boy and he looked entirely to the future. “The inspiration
of his work was the idea of breaking sharply and completely with the
past, and constructing a system that borrows nothing from the dead,”<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a> which suggests that the idea of
Progress owed its origin as much to a reaction against the pedantry of
the Renaissance as to reform by external means, which in the excessive
consideration it gave to the opinions of the Ancients, operated to
strangle all vitality out of thought.</p>
<section class="footnotes footnotes-end-of-block" role="doc-endnotes">
<ol start="4">
<li id="fn4" role="doc-endnote"><p><em>The Idea of Progress</em>,
p. 67.<a href="#fnref4" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>
</ol>
</section>
<p>Now, in rebelling against this pedantry, there can be no doubt that
Descartes and his followers were entirely in the right; for we know only
too well the disastrous effect that the pedantry of the Renaissance had
upon literature, architecture, and the crafts and arts generally—it
strangled every bit of life out of them. The confusion in which the arts
find themselves to-day is to be traced to the destruction of aesthetic
perception and power of design by these selfsame academic influences.
But, on the other hand, it is equally certain that the idea of Progress
has been followed by results no less disastrous; for by undermining
respect for the achievements of the past it has destroyed the mental
balance and breadth of outlook necessary to real achievement. These
considerations lead us to the conclusion that the idea of Progress and
the pedantic influences of the Renaissance are but two aspects of the
same disease, inasmuch as they have combined to undermine right feeling
and attitude towards things, making it impossible for the modern man to
enter sympathetically into the great heritage of the past or to face
realistically the problems of the present.</p>
<p>While Descartes claimed the right to break sharply and completely
with the past, his claim was only made in respect to the sciences; for
in religion he was orthodox. But it so happened that the method which he
advocated in connection with the sciences was given a wider application
by his followers. And it was thus currents of thought were set in motion
that had far-reaching effects, proving themselves to be fatal to all
clear thinking about religion, philosophy, art, and sociology which are
not to be separated from their roots in history. The Cartesian doubt—the
resolution provisionally to doubt everything—is a necessary condition of
intellectual advance. Its defect, says the Spanish philosopher Unamuno,
is to be found ” in the resolution of Descartes to begin by emptying
himself of himself, of Descartes, of the real man, the man of flesh and
bone, the man who does not want to die, in order that he might be a mere
thinker—that is an abstraction”;<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5" role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a> for to proceed on such a
method is to introduce a logic that operates to divorce the subjective
from the objective side of thought and life. On the contrary, the right
method of reasoning is not to begin with external phenomenon but with
ourselves. What we can know and feel of the world is finally what we can
know and feel in ourselves. It is only by penetrating deep into our own
interior nature that we can discover those strands that bind us to
others and the world. For what is the property of each is the property
of all. The macrocosm can only be studied in the microcosm. And
therefore it is necessary if we are, so to say, to feel our feet in the
world of thought, to have the liberty if need be to break with the
past—that is, to doubt what other men have said in order to prove it to
ourselves. But men who go exploring are apt to get lost. And they can
lose them- selves more easily in the depths of their own nature than in
the exterior universe. Hence it is if men who seek after wisdom are to
retain their balance and sanity, it is essential for them to be for ever
seeking to correct their own judgments and intuitions by comparing them
with the general experience of mankind. For men in the mass are in some
respects wiser than any single individual, however much error and
stupidity may be mixed with the wisdom. And therefore the more a man
finds reason to differ with his own generation, the more important it is
for him to study the past; for only when he is familiar with what men
thought and felt in other ages can he see the thought of his day in a
proper perspective. Hence the conclusion that truth is finally neither
subjective nor objective, but resides at a point midway between the
two.</p>

<p>To reason clearly on this issue is of fundamental importance, because
under the influence of the idea of Progress the subjective and objective
sides of life have become fatally divided, and all manner of evil has
followed the division. After Descartes, men could say with Protagoras,
“My thought is the measure of things.” Thus an idea was set in motion
that operated slowly to disintegrate the common mind, and with it the
possibility of collective activity for any useful purpose. People who
are accustomed to underrate the importance and influence of ideas would
do well to reflect on the tragic consequences of this one, which has led
men everywhere to deny the existence of any absolute right, whilst
affirming that truth is entirely a matter of opinion. Is it not apparent
that in making the departure he did, Descartes knocked the bottom out of
the mind, breaking down the bridge that makes brotherhood possible, by
bringing into existence an atmosphere of credulity and intellectual
instability in which the false prophet is always sure of a hearing and
the prize goes to the man who can tell the tallest story.</p>
<p>Faith in Progress was until yesterday the faith of the modern world.
But it cannot be said to be so any longer; for the events of the last
eight years have led to widespread scepticism in regard to the future.
But if we are to see the most consummate expression of the idea of
Progress we must go to the Socialist movement, which has based its
activities upon it without any reservation or qualification. Generally
speaking, those who accepted the idea of Progress did not cut themselves
off entirely from the past. They accepted the idea in a vague way as
meaning that in the gradual ascent of man the same interplay of forces
which they supposed had conducted him so far would, with the increase of
liberty, lead him towards conditions of increasing happiness and
prosperity, for in their universe catastrophe did not exist. But with
Socialists it was different. They took their stand on what was central
in the idea of Progress—that it was necessary to break sharply and
completely with the past, and proposed to reconstruct society on a basis
that borrowed nothing from the social organisation or experience of
former times. At least that was their idea at the outset, for when they
settled down to work they found themselves unable to get as far away
from reality as they had hoped. But to this extent it is true. They had
an <em>a priori</em> prejudice against all forms of social organisation
which had existed in the past and had since disappeared; for they took
it for granted that all such organisations belonged to a lower stage of
social evolution and therefore could have no relevance to the problems
of to-day. All who have fought for the Guild idea know this notion only
too well. This prejudice has much to do with the perplexity of the
Socialist movement to-day; for, having denied the experience of the
past, it has nothing to fall back upon now that modern things are to be
seen everywhere collapsing.</p>
<p>But it is not only in their desire to break sharply and completely
with the past that Socialists followed in the path of Descartes. Their
philosophy exhibits the same fatal division between the subjective and
objective sides of life. The Guild, which was the type and exemplar of
Mediaeval organisation, postulated in its organisation the essential
unity of life; for it touched the subjective and objective sides of life
at one and the same time. Socialist organisation, however, is entirely
objective in the sense that it bears no relation whatsoever to the
subjective life of man, as is recognised in the popular criticism which
says it leaves human nature out of account. But while Socialist
organisation is objective, Socialist thought is subjective. This is
another source of the difficulties of the movement. For if there is no
ultimate standard of right and wrong, if truth is entirely a matter of
opinion, as the subjective philosophy postulates, then no real basis of
co-operation between individuals exists. Men can only unite with one
another on the assumption that they share common beliefs and work for
common ends. And therefore co-operation becomes impossible wherever men
have become individualised in their beliefs. Thus we see that the
subjective philosophy is antipathetic to collective activity. And it is
because of this that the Socialist movement has throughout its history
been perplexed by internal dissensions; for in attempting to organise
for communal ends people whose standards of thought are entirely
subjective it attempts the impossible; it seeks to organise the
unorganisable. And, because it attempts the impossible, it can have no
future apart from such a change in spirit as would revolutionize its
thought. The future is with those who are united in positive and
fundamental beliefs, not with those who are united only in their
detestation of the existing social order.</p>

<section id="iii.-the-kingdom-of-god" class="level1">
<h1>III. The Kingdom of God</h1>
<p>Once it is realised that belief in the sufficiency of that automatic
movement of social and economic development which before the War was
known by the name of Progress is nothing more than a superstition,
inasmuch as, so far from laying a foundation upon which a new social
order could be built, experience has revealed it to be a movement
towards the disintegration of everything that was hard and permanent in
the world, it follows that our only hope of social salvation is to take
our stand on something that has within itself the elements of permanence
and stability. Over against the world of movement and flux, of progress
and relativity, we must set up a standard of unchanging reality, of
absolute and immutable values which are unaffected by the fluid elements
on the changing surface of things. Such values are to be found in the
traditions of Christianity, and to them we must return. For only
principles that rest upon supernatural sanction are invested with
sufficient authority to secure for them popular acceptance.</p>
<p>But comes the objection: the problem confronting the workers is a
material one, it is a bread-and-butter question, and therefore
Christianity has no relevance; for it is not primarily concerned with
the affairs of this world but the next. Considering the way Christianity
has for long been presented in the Churches, such a view is excusable.
For until yesterday, the Churches since the Reformation treated
Christianity entirely as a gospel of personal salvation that had nothing
to say about the social question. Yet such a presentation is not the
Gospel as it was taught by Christ and as it was believed in by the Early
Christians, to whom Christianity was as much an affair of the redemption
of this world as of salvation in the next. And what is more, this
attitude of the Early Christians became embodied in the dogmas of the
Church; for as Señor de Maeztu pointed out in a recent article,<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6" role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a> it is the Resurrection of the Body
and the Life Everlasting upon which the Christian Creeds insist, while
it is equally significant that no mention is made in them of the
Immortality of the Soul. And there is a reason for this; for the
doctrine of the Resurrection of the Body is just as much a symbol of the
Early Christians’ belief in the redemption of this world as the
Immortality of the Soul is the symbol of the fatalistic attitude which
until yesterday the Churches assumed towards the social question.</p>

</section>
<p>Let us consider this matter further. Not only is the significance of
the doctrine of the Resurrection of the Body rarely understood, but
ignorance as to its meaning is one of the stumbling-blocks in the path
of the revival of Christianity; for the doctrine does not relate to our
existing physical bodies, as is popularly supposed, but to the fact that
in any final consummation the bodily life of man must find a place no
less than the spiritual.”<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7" role="doc-noteref"><sup>7</sup></a> As such, the doctrine was formulated
to combat the Manichaean heresy which, in divorcing spirit from matter,
led men to place all their hopes in the next world to the neglect of the
claims of this. According to Christian doctrine, there is no such
divorce between spirit and matter; for Christianity is both spiritual
and material. There are good spirits and evil spirits, while the bodily
life of man might be good or bad according to the spirit in which men
lived. The Manichaeans, on the contrary, taught a doctrine which cuts
right across the Christian conception. They identified good and evil
with spirit and matter. According to them spirit was good and matter was
evil. And it was in order to combat the evils arising from this
perverted attitude of mind that the Christian Fathers were led to
formulate the doctrine of the Resurrection of the Body; for the
practical consequences that followed the acceptance of the one
conception or the other cannot easily be exaggerated. The Manichaean
conception of life and the universe leads directly to contempt of the
body and indifference towards the secular order of society, which it
regards as beyond redemption on the one hand, or to pure worldliness on
the other. The Christian conception, on the contrary, leads directly to
a frank acceptance of the bodily life of man and a belief in the
possibility of social redemption. For if the body is important, then the
life of man on earth is important. The life of this world may be
transient, yet it is an essential part of the next. If we neglect to
take measures to make truth and justice prevail in this world, what
reason is there to suppose we shall be equipped to make them prevail in
the next? “The other world is this world in the fulness of its
consequences.” Hence the Kingdom of God around which the social teaching
of Jesus moves. The phrase or its equivalent, the Kingdom of Heaven,
occurs more than a hundred times in the first three Gospels. Its purpose
was the establishment of the Kingdom upon this earth, and not its
postponement to a life hereafter—a subtle evasion of the problems of the
secular world as it has come to mean.</p>

</section>
<p>Though the reality of the Kingdom has been neglected by Christians in
modern times, there can be little doubt that it was a central idea in
the teaching of Christ. By the Kingdom Jesus undoubtedly meant a new
social order which it is God’s purpose to establish in this world, and
of which He is the head. The phrase had long been familiar to His
hearers. It was the term in which the pious Jews expressed their
anticipation of a time when the national ideal of Israel should at last
be realised and the prophet’s vision of a just and prosperous society be
fulfilled. Jesus took this earlier association for granted while seeking
to give the idea a richer and larger content. It was not to be merely a
new social system of man’s devising, but something extending beyond this
world into the next; while its approach was not to be primarily through
political activity but through moral regeneration, through the
redemption of the individual. The entire social order was to be
Christianised. The world as a whole was the subject of redemption.</p>
<p>If it can be affirmed that it was the intention of Jesus to establish
the Kingdom upon earth, with even greater confidence it can be affirmed
that such was the meaning given to His words by His hearers, for how
else is the communism of the Early Church at Jerusalem to be explained?
This first attempt to realise the Kingdom clearly demonstrates that to
them the new life which Jesus proclaimed not only involved an inward
change of heart but an outward change of circumstance, since for the
sake of the Kingdom they were prepared to give up everything. The
attempt failed because it was premature. It was premature because the
inward change of spirit necessary to the establishment of a new social
order had not proceeded sufficiently far to make such a complete break
with the traditions of society a practicable proposition. Nevertheless,
the spirit of communism remained in the Church. But it remained as an
ideal rather than as a method, expressing itself in care for the poor,
attacks upon wealth, the condemnation of luxury, and insistence upon the
duty of honest labour. Thus in one way or another very powerful solvents
were brought to bear upon the established social order, operating to
remove the barriers that stood in the way of brotherhood and destined in
time so completely to undermine the foundations on which Pagan
civilisation rested as to prepare the way for far-reaching social and
political changes. It gradually modified the attitude towards slavery,
which by the fourth century was a doomed institution, though it lingered
on in places for centuries.</p>
<p>That faith in the early establishment of the Kingdom, the dreams and
hopes that it raised, materially contributed to the success of the
Gospel and remained a force in the Church for centuries is admitted. Its
disappearance would, in the first place, appear to be due to the fact
that as on the sociological side of Christianity no systematic body of
doctrine was built up corresponding to its carefully formulated
theology, the enthusiasm of the millennialists was allowed to spend its
force in wild dreams about the Kingdom instead of being directed into
channels where it would have borne fruit; and in the next place to the
disillusionment that came over the Roman world after the year 410, when
Rome was sacked by the Goths. Rome had long ceased to be more than a
symbol of Empire, but as such it was so entirely identified with every
conception of orderly government that its fall had a tremendous effect
on the imagination of men; for in being generally recognised as
heralding the collapse of the old world, it not only dispelled
millennial dreams but raised the question as to whether the Church
itself was also destined to perish with the secular order. It was
answered by St. Augustine, who, in the succeeding years, wrote his great
treatise on Christian political philosophy, <em>De Civitate Dei</em>—The
City of God—to restore Faith to the world. In it he completely
identified the Church with the Kingdom. The old Roman Empire was
tottering to its fall ; the Church stood fast, ready to step into its
inheritance. Others before him may have taken the same view. Yet he was
the first who ventured to teach that the Visible Church was the Kingdom
of God, that the millennial kingdom commenced with the appearance of
Christ on earth, and was therefore an accomplished fact. By this
doctrine Augustine gave a new direction to Western theology, carrying it
clear of millennialism, which very soon became a thing of the past,
while certain elements of it became branded as heretical. But though
perhaps it saved the Church at the moment, it did it by perverting the
purpose of Christianity, for in identifying the Church with the Kingdom
it destroyed for ever the possibility of the redemption of the secular
order of society. According to Augustine’s view, the human race is to be
divided into two parts, “the one consisting of those who live according
to man, the other of those who live according to God,” which he
mystically calls the two cities, one of which was predestined to reign
eternally with God, and the other to suffer eternal punishment with the
devil. While the City of God is concerned with spiritual values, the
City of Satan is of the earth earthly, though to the question of the
relation in which the two cities stand to one another according to God’s
purpose he can find no answer.</p>
<p>The implications of St. Augustine’s position are enormous; for this
division of the human race into two parts involves a terrible
degradation of earthly duties with which the majority of men must of
necessity be primarily concerned. Yet though Augustine attacks the
dualism of Manichaeanism, it is apparent that his own central idea of
the two cities is Manichaean rather than Christian, for it postulates
the divorce of the spiritual from the temporal, while it naturally led
him to identify the Kingdom with the Church. These perversions of the
teaching of Christianity are important because, as the influence of
St. Augustine on the Middle Ages was decisive, they are to be held
accountable for much—perhaps for the defeat of Christianity itself; for
there are some who see the whole Hildebrandine policy, the controversies
between Popes and Emperors, as indeed the “dominion of grace” of
Wycliffe and the predestination of Calvin, which between them have
alienated the world from Christianity, implicit in the pages of <em>De
Civitate Dei</em>.<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8" role="doc-noteref"><sup>8</sup></a></p>

civilisation collapse? There are reasons and reasons. I hold the true
one to be because at the root of that civilisation there was a lie.
Mediaeval civilisation identified the Church with the Kingdom of God.
The Church, instead of promoting the Kingdom, replaced it. The
usurpation of the Church and its disparagement of the other modes
through which the Kingdom is built, brought with it the inevitable
consequence. Catholicism degenerated in the slavish worship of its own
organisation, and that organisation became a tyranny from which men at

has assumed a different form…”<a href="#fnref8" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>

</section>
<p>In affirming, therefore, the centrality of the doctrine of the
Kingdom, we are not only recalling the Church to its original purpose,
but we are doing something towards purging the Church of its Manichaean
tendencies, which stand between the modern world and the acceptance of
the principles of Christianity. It is important to insist upon these
things, because the world is faced to-day with a situation in many ways
analogous to that which confronted the Roman world in the early part of
the fifth century. The shock of the world-catastrophe has produced an
effect on the minds of men to-day very similar, it is to be imagined, to
the effect that the sack of Rome by Alaric had on Roman society; while
since the War we become daily more conscious that the fabric of society
has been shattered beyond repair^ And becoming increasingly conscious of
the fleeting nature of the circumstances of life, of the instability of
our material environment, we look round for something that possesses
within itself the elements of permanence, and like St. Augustine we find
it in Christian doctrine. For just as he felt in the crisis through
which the Roman world was passing, that with the collapse of the old
order leadership devolved upon the Church, so we, facing a parallel
situation, are equally convinced that in Christianity is to be found the
key. But its activities will have to be of a fundamentally different
nature; for the problem confronting the world to-day is not how to save
civilisation from an external enemy, but how to save it from internal
corruption and disintegration, while so far from the teachings of
St. Augustine being of any service to us in this task, it is from the
very consequences of his teaching that we need to be saved. For the
great evil to-day is dualism—the consequence of the Manichaeanism with
which he infected Christianity. The separation of the material from the
spiritual has proceeded so far that not only have our politics and
industry become so corrupt that it often seems impossible to bring any
moral influence to bear upon them, but we are caught in the toils of an
economic and industrial system that has made us all its slaves, and
therefore a solution of our problems is not to be found in exalting the
Church as a sanctuary, in providing a refuge to enable men to escape
from the world, but by recalling the Church to its original purpose, as
the instrument for the establishment of the Kingdom of God. Apart from
spiritual influences, it would appear that the normal trend of things is
downwards. For the evidence is only too conclusive that, left to
themselves, men tend so to degenerate that spiritual things are entirely
crowded out of their lives. Circumstances, self-interests,
considerations of expediency all conspire to this end. For it is only
when men are in possession of fixed principles which challenge this
tendency that they have the courage to resist. It is for this reason
that not until men are in possession of a sociology that will define the
Christian attitude towards political and economic questions that they
will be able to make a stand for principles and assert again the claims
of the spirit that the steady process of demoralisation that has
overtaken the modern world will be stopped. Not until then will the tide
be turned, for against economic expediency nothing less than such
principles can stand.</p>
</section>
<section id="iv.-the-life-in-the-kingdom" class="level1">
<h1>IV. The Life in the Kingdom</h1>
<p>It is evident that the condition of society contemplated by Jesus in
His Kingdom was one in which a balance was maintained between the
spiritual and material sides of life. But as it so happens that left to
themselves men tend to degenerate into materialism, and undue
concentration upon the material side of things tends to choke the
spiritual life, it is necessary, if a balance is to be preserved between
the spiritual and material sides of life, to be for ever insisting upon
the importance of the spiritual life. Spiritual things must come first.
“Take ye no thought saying, what shall we eat, or what shall we drink,
and wherewithal shall we be clothed (for after all these things do the
Gentiles seek) for your heavenly Father knoweth that ye have need of
these things. But seek ye first the Kingdom of God and His
righteousness, and all these things shall be added unto you.” This is
the true political economy; it was the political economy of Christendom;
and it is the political economy to which we must return; for it was
precisely because the Mediaevalists, within certain limits, pursued this
ideal that they were not troubled with the problem of riches and poverty
that perplexes us to-day. Jesus did not, like modern economists, begin
with any detailed analysis of external conditions, with the relation of
man to his environment, but with the relation of man to God, confident
in the knowledge that if men only believed in and worshipped the things
of the spirit they would not find the ordering of their economic life a
problem of insuperable difficulty.</p>
<p>What we understand by industrialism is the organisation of life and
society upon the opposite assumption. It says in so many words, “Seek ye
first material prosperity, and all other things shall be added unto
you.” But somehow or other the promise is not fulfilled. The other
things are not added, while experience is proving that in the long run
the pursuit of riches does not even bring material prosperity. And there
is a reason for this. The concentration of all effort and mental energy
upon material achievement upsets the spiritual equilibrium of society.
It awakens the spirit of avarice which operates to disintegrate the
common life, and brings in its train great contrasts of wealth and
poverty. Out of these contrasts come pride, envy, jealousy, national and
class hatreds, economic and military warfare, and finally the
destruction of the wealth that has been so laboriously created. For no
civilisation built on a lie can endure. That, ultimately, is the reason
why our civilisation is breaking down. The pursuit of materialism
defeats its own ends by bringing into existence such a monstrous
disproportion between the material and spiritual sides of life that the
spiritual is incapable of shaping the material to human and social
ends.</p>
<p>Spiritual values must come first because the first thing to be
considered in the arrangements of any social order is the quality of
life which men live. In Socialist theory and propaganda this is
considered a matter of no relevance. Every individual is to be at
liberty to live just as he likes, to do whatever takes his fancy, to
live a life of luxury, to acknowledge no restraints except of the
grosser kind which delivers him into the hands of the policeman; for
according to the Socialist point of view all such questions are entirely
personal ones which each individual can decide for himself, and have
nothing whatsoever to do with the economic problem, which is to be
solved as a separate and detached issue in the domains of politics and
industry. But Jesus thought differently. He did not approach life and
society as a series of separate problems of religion, morality,
politics, art, economics, etc., but as one problem with many aspects.
Further, He did not consider all the aspects of equal importance. On the
contrary. He gave precedence to the spiritual side of the problem. It
was what men believed and did and worshipped that finally mattered, and
must be attended to first; for spiritual truth was the leaven that kept
life pure and wholesome. The solution of the economic problem which
confronted society in our Lord’s time, much as it does in ours, would be
easy if men could be persuaded to give to spiritual values the first
place in their lives.</p>
<p>The important thing was the life lived, but the right life was
impossible so long as men were absorbed in material pursuits and ends.
Men had to be born again. The social problem was something more than a
problem of economics. Rightly considered, it was but the more obtrusive
symptom of an internal spiritual disease that had followed the triumph
of materialism. It was for this reason that He insisted that “No man can
serve two masters: he cannot serve God and Mammon.”</p>
<p>Looked at from this point of view, the problem confronting modern
society is the problem of how to restore the balance between the
spiritual and material sides of life that have been so completely upset
by a century and a half of industrialism. There are still, I suppose, in
spite of the War, and the Peace, and the social, economic, and political
confusion that has followed and involved us all, some cheerful and
optimistic people who believe that the present confusion is but
incidental to a state of transition in which our industrial system will
be conquered and redeemed and man become as much the master of things as
he was in the pre-machine age. But industry becomes daily more complex,
and as it becomes more complex the chances of any such redemption become
more and more remote; for as it increases in complexity it makes demands
on our alertness and many-sidedness to which our wits and sympathies are
unable to respond. If ever the human spirit is to come again to its own,
if it is to emancipate itself from the tyranny of things, we shall have
no option but to return to simpler conditions of life and society, such
as would reduce the complexity of our relationships to terms
commensurate with the human understanding. Any idea of subordinating our
industrial system to moral, aesthetic, and religious ends by
“spiritualising the machine,” as some define their aim, is vain and
impossible. You might as well try to spiritualise a crocodile.</p>
<p>Industrialism came into existence for material and not for spiritual
ends, and will obey the laws of its own being to the finish; for as it
proceeds it excludes from its ranks all who serve other ends. Fifty
years ago, before industrialism finally conquered, it might have been
redeemed if men had been persuaded of the necessity. But fifty years ago
men were too much hypnotised by machinery; they were too much enthralled
by the unexplored possibilities of mechanical production to listen to
the words of warning Ruskin and others so plainly uttered.</p>
<p>In such circumstances, if the balance between the spiritual and
material sides of life is to be restored, we must be prepared to
renounce mechanical methods of production wherever they are found to
stand in the way of the spiritual life; for it is only by putting
spiritual things first that society may be reconstructed. All my
reasoning on the social problem brings me to this conclusion, and I am
strengthened in my conviction that such is the case by the knowledge
that Jesus Christ insisted always on the primacy of spiritual things. It
is not through revolutionary upheavals but through an awakened spiritual
consciousness that mankind will grope its way out of chaos. But I fear
that it may prove difficult to persuade the working class, who are the
principal sufferers in our social confusion, that the social problem is
primarily a spiritual one. They are confronted in their lives by hard
material facts. Their crying need is for the opportunity of
self-development which poverty has denied them. It is not surprising,
therefore, that they should come to the conclusion that the problem is
primarily a material one and should view with suspicion all who affirm
the contrary, as people who seek to betray them. All the same, it is an
illusion, for, as Mr. Tawney recently put it, “to say that poverty is
the greatest evil is to give sanction to the idea that riches is the
greatest good,” and therefore to misdirect reform activities by urging
them towards a goal that is not only false but positively vicious. It is
for this reason that it is no accident that all efforts to secure reform
on a purely material basis should have failed; for nothing militates
against clear thinking on social questions and really effective action
so much as the desire to be immediately practical, for in practice it
means that short-sighted views come to be preferred to long ones; and
that is the curse from which we should pray to be delivered.</p>
<p>But it will be said the Labour movement is a spiritual revival,
inasmuch as it is an attempt to express the spirit of Jesus in everyday
life. This is true up to a certain point; for it is not to be denied
that with an altruism that gives the lie to their theory that material
factors have finally determined the course of history, the Labour
movement has been a source of real inspiration to thousands, leading
them to throw their energies into the attempt to secure for others those
opportunities which have been denied themselves. Yet it cannot but
appear as an anomaly that a movement of such spiritual potentiality
should subscribe to the tenets of a philosophy that rests upon material
values, while there can be no doubt that this contradiction lies at the
root of the failure of Labour, thwarting their every effort to achieve
emancipation. It is a heresy, and like all heresies it leads to quarrels
and dissensions; for in every crisis the Labour movement becomes a house
divided against itself.</p>
</section>
<section id="v.-the-great-commandment-of-the-law" class="level1">
<h1>V. The Great Commandment of the Law</h1>
<p>We saw that in the mind of Jesus the most fundamental requisite for
social salvation was a willingness on the part of men to acknowledge the
primacy of spiritual things, since only on this assumption could a
balance be maintained between the spiritual and material sides of life.
But it is necessary for another reason. Unless men consent to put
spiritual things first, they cannot finally unite among one another; for
in that case the cement will be lacking to bind men together in the
bonds of brotherhood. Hence it was that in answer to a lawyer who asked
what was the great commandment of the law Jesus replied, “Thou shalt
love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, with all thy soul, with all
thy mind, and with all thy strength. And the second is like unto it.
Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself. On these two commandments hang
all the law and the prophets,” thereby affirming the primacy of
spiritual values as the only possible basis for a common or corporate
life.</p>
<p>Let me quote in this connection the words of Señor de Maeztu: “The
commandment,” he says, “which compels me to love my neighbour as myself,
does not tell me how to love my neighbour, for it does not tell me how I
ought to love myself. There are happy moments when I love for myself
truth, justice and the tragic and supreme beauty of sacrifice. There are
other moments when I love for myself flattery, although it may be false;
power, although it may be stolen; and pleasure, although it may degrade
both my body and mind. And if 1 love my neighbour as myself, why should
I not also love for my neighbour false flattery, usurped power, and
degrading pleasures? And this supposition is not merely imaginative. The
altruistic drunkard wants his neighbours to get drunk; and the
voluptuary is usually an altruist in the sense that he wants the
greatest possible diffusion of his vices…</p>
<p>“Love of one’s neighbour does not acquire a positive value except
when it depends upon the first and great commandment, which is the love
of God. Non-religious persons may reply that they do not know what is
being asked of them when they are told to love God… What we assert is
that love of cultural values is love of the Divine Substance, and
therefore love of God.</p>
<p>“But to the first and great commandment Jesus added the second, ‘Love
thy neighbour as thyself,’ and it was necessary to add this, for the men
who have come to love God in His substance, or in His Person, have known
the temptation of feeling a certain repugnance towards their neighbour
and towards themselves. He who loves the good, easily falls into the sin
of not loving man; for man is a sinner; he who loves truth feels more
pity than love for this poor human reason, whose limitations are as
familiar to him as they are painful. And he who loves the power that
preserves and increases goodness and truth, easily yields to the
temptation of despising his own weakness and the weakness of his
neighbour. And yet we must love man, for the love of man is necessary
for the preservation of truth in the world. With all his limitations, we
hope that man is carrying out some function in the world; for otherwise
we could find no meaning in his existence. The man who loves God must be
commanded to love his neighbour and himself, for he is the one who
realises better the faults of human kind… If a human society is a
partnership in cultural values, its constitution is desirable, and then
the fellowship of its members must be added to it to make it prosper.”<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9" role="doc-noteref"><sup>9</sup></a></p>

<p>Perhaps now we may begin to understand upon what basis a Christian
sociology must rest. It is upon the mutual dependence of the love of God
and one’s neighbour. Neither of these commandments can stand alone. A
right relationship with God is necessary to a right relationship with
men and <em>vice versa</em>. But it has been the error of Socialists to
suppose that it is possible to build up a new social system upon the
love of one’s neighbour whilst ignoring the necessity for any love of
God in his Person or in his Substance, giving to material values the
primacy that belongs to the spiritual. And this has led to an inversion
of the natural order of things, in which the will of the people takes
the place of the will of God. <em>Vox populi, vox Dei</em>. There are
times when the voice of the people is clearly the voice of God. When the
people rebel against injustice we may be assured that God is with them.
But the voice of the people is raised at times for other causes at the
bidding of selfish interests. And Christians, at any rate, should not
forget that it was raised to crucify their Lord. It is therefore
necessary to discriminate.</p>
<p>If Christ came to-day, it may be assumed that the common people would
hear Him gladly. But can we be sure they would follow Him to the end? A
conflict between Him and the people would perhaps be inevitable. For the
majority of people are short-sighted and are apt to become very
impatient with those who take longer views. This is one of the
difficulties connected with democracy. However much we may sympathise
with the people in their sufferings, however much we may wish to see
their grievances redressed, let us not lose sight of this fact. They are
ready to listen to those who flatter them, who tell them that nothing
can stand in the way of the consummation of their will, who hold out
promises to them that they do not know how to fulfil, but they are by no
means so ready to listen to those who tell them the truth when it
conflicts with their own immediate desires and interests. And it is
because of this that evil is so powerful in the world. The whole power
of evil rests ultimately upon its capacity to offer immediate
advantages. It tempts men by pleasures that it may hold them in its
grip. It builds up a power to enslave men in their capacity as producers
by making itself subservient to their whims as consumers. It persuades
men to sell their birthright for a mess of pottage. And so it is, unless
people are willing to acknowledge and serve some higher principle than
is dictated by their own appetites and desires, there can be for them no
hope of social salvation. For so long as they remain the slaves of their
own desires, capitalism will be able to devise some means of exploiting
them.</p>
<p>Meanwhile the democratic movement suffers from a conflict of wills.
This perplexity follows naturally from the fact that a power built up by
an appeal to selfish interests cannot be used for the enforcement of
unselfish principles, and disappointment with attempts to do so creates
a spirit of resentment in the hearts of those who expected most.
Democracy in its despair has come to repudiate its own leaders. This
nemesis of democracy is the natural consequence of attempting to
separate the love of one’s neighbour from the love of God.’ For when men
cease to love God in His Person or in His Substance there no longer
exists any common bond of sympathy and understanding between the people
and their natural leaders. There is no cement to bind together men of
different grades of intelligence, as was the case in the Middle Ages,
when king and peasant, priest and craftsman were bound together by a
common religious tradition which, however much they might disagree, was
stronger than their differences. In the absence of this shared and
common tradition, the wise are no longer understood of the people, and
they tend to drift apart because they do not readily discover points of
contact. And when the wise are gone the end is in sight. The people
begin to follow the leadership of those who make themselves subservient
to their every whim, who flatter their Vanity, and make promises that
they do not know how to fulfil until the day of reckoning comes and
rebellion against all leadership whatsoever manifests itself in the
rank-and-file. This is the explanation of the democratic temper to-day.
Rightly interpreted, the rebellion against leadership is not a rebellion
against all leadership, but against false leadership. And as such, it is
finally a rebellion against the very doctrines in which the workers
profess to believe; against an ideal of democracy that would separate
love of one’s neighbour from the love of God.</p>

<section id="vi.-the-church-and-the-common-mind" class="level1">
<h1>VI. The Church and the Common Mind</h1>
<p>We saw that the basis of a Christian sociology was to be found in the
mutual dependence of the love of God and one’s neighbour. But if ideas
are to exercise a permanent influence on the world of affairs, it is
essential for them to be embodied in institutions. Hence the Church,
which our Lord founded and left behind Him to continue the work He had
begun. It was, as we saw, not to be regarded as an end in itself, such
as it has come to be, but as an instrument for the establishment of the
Kingdom of God.</p>
<p>But though Jesus meant that the Church was to be considered as a
means rather than an end, He did not mean that a time would ever come
when the Kingdom would be established once and for ever; because, as a
matter of fact, in the sense of finality it never can be established. On
the contrary, if it is to continue living, its life must be renewed
daily; and it is for this reason that the Church as a visible and
organised institution will always be necessary. It will always be
necessary, moreover, because Christianity is the religion of the
Incarnation. Spirit and form, soul and body cannot by the essential
principle of faith be divided. To bring about harmony between them,
between the inner and the outward life, between truth and its visible
expression. between religion and civilisation is the task to which
Christianity is committed. And as there can be no finality in these
things, the Church will always be necessary to effect renewal and
adjustment.</p>
<p>From a sociological point of view, the first function of the Church
is to maintain in society the acceptance of common standards of thought
and morals. This is a necessary condition of any stable social order,
because if men are to share a common life they must share a common mind,
for there must be a common mind if men are to act together. We have
moved so far away from the thought and impulse of the Middle Ages that
there are few to-day who recognise the fundamental importance of the
common mind to any successful ordering of our social arrangements. Yet
it is only necessary to reflect on the general social and political
situation to-day to realise that in recognising its importance the
Mediaevalists were right while the Modernists in failing to do so are
wrong. What is the secret of the apathy of the present day The immediate
cause is, doubtless, disillusionment. For centuries society has
worshipped at the shrine of mammon, science, and mechanism. Men saw the
immediate advantages which followed their surrender to them, while they
concealed from themselves their evil side, which was tolerated, nay,
justified, as incidental to the cause of progress. They refused to judge
this development by any fixed standard of right and wrong, preferring to
take their stand on the doctrine of evolution according to which any
evil can be justified as a temporary phenomenon inevitable to a time of
transition on the assumption that truth and justice will prevail in the
end. But it has not worked out as expected. Experience has proved that
figs do not grow on thistles, though the culture may be scientific. The
pursuit of wealth has not resulted in a more equitable distribution, as
Adam Smith prophesied, but has widened the gulf between rich and poor,
while it is seen to end in widespread unemployment. It has corrupted
business and politics, concentrated power, and built up irresponsible
and impersonal tyrannies. Our industrial system has not liberated but
enslaved men, while it uses up raw materials at such an alarming rate
that the problem of securing new supplies has become a perpetual menace
to peace. It is for such reasons that the feeling grows that modern
civilisation is breaking up, while science, as detached as ever, invents
poison-gas to ensure that the destruction shall be complete.</p>
<p>It is easy to understand why the awakening of the world to these
perils should have led to some disillusionment. But the disillusionment
would not have led to apathy but for another thing. The man of to-day
has no idea how to stop the rot that threatens civilisation; and he has
no idea how to stop it because there is no longer in existence a common
mind; and because the common mind no longer exists it is impossible to
secure any widespread agreement as to what requires to be done. For so
long have men enjoyed freedom of thought and speech, for so long has
such freedom been exalted as an end in itself, for so long has every
false prophet who attacked the very foundations of right thinking and
feeling enjoyed immunity, that the average mind to-day is in such a
hopeless state of confusion about everything that it is impossible to
get agreement about anything that really matters. And so it comes about
that in the absence of any positive idea on which to unite, men to-day
associate for negative purposes—not to promote what is right, but to
denounce what is wrong; for after all, Socialist schemes of
reconstruction are little more than organised negations, as the Labour
Party’s election manifesto bears witness. The desperate position in
which, owing to the disappearance of a common mind, men find themselves
to-day makes them attempt to co-operate by sinking their differences, on
the assumption that the attainment of power is the first thing necessary
to social salvation. But all such attempts avail nothing; for a power
that is built up by sinking differences is not a real power but a sham
one, that goes to pieces wherever it comes into collision with
realities. It is for this reason that the Labour Party tends to lose
effective strength in proportion as it grows in numbers. Its recent
accession of strength<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10" role="doc-noteref"><sup>10</sup></a> enables its voice to be heard, and
will doubtless result in many things being done to mitigate existing
evils that would not be done but for the fear of a Labour Government. To
this extent the Party is doing useful work. Yet the voice it raises is
finally the voice of protest and negation rather than of a prophetic and
constructive vision. The members of the Party can unite in their
protests against war, on behalf of the unemployed, to prevent the
decontrol of rents and in their attacks upon capital. But their points
of agreement are superficial, while their disagreements are fundamental,
and so it is an open question as to how long they will be able to remain
united; for having put their trust in numbers rather than in clear
thinking, their faith has become an amorphous conglomeration of
conflicting beliefs, and it needs but the shock of reality to expose its
weakness.</p>

</section>
<p>In these circumstances not only do we see the urgency of re-creating
the common mind, but we begin to understand why in former times heresy
was suppressed. It was suppressed because when men had a firm grip of
fundamental truth they realised that any idea that attacked the unity of
the Faith threatened the existence of the common mind, and therefore the
stability of society by undermining its capacity to resist evil
influences. It was for this reason that in the Middle Ages the heretic
was looked upon as a traitor to society, and why for centuries the
suppression of heresy was a popular movement. We miss the significance
of this suppression if we assume that it was undertaken solely for
ecclesiastical reasons. On the contrary, it is to be observed that the
suppression of heresy has, with exceptions, been undertaken from secular
rather than religious motives, and by civil rather than ecclesiastical
authorities, while there is nothing peculiarly Christian or Mediaeval
about it. The Greeks condemned Socrates to death because it was held
that his teaching undermined respect for the gods, while Plato finally
came to the conclusion that to doubt the gods should be a crime
punishable by death. The Roman Emperors persecuted the Christians for
refusing observance of the gods, while it was the best Emperors who were
opposed to the advance of Christianity and the worst ones who were
indifferent to its encroachment—Marcus Aurelius himself being no
exception to this rule. And what is more interesting, it was not until
Christianity became the official religion of the Empire that there was
any persecution of heretics in the interests of Christianity. Then the
successors of Constantine, continuing in the persuasion of the Pagan
Emperors that the first concern of the imperial authority was the
protection of religion, persecuted men for not being Christians in the
same spirit that their predecessors persecuted men because they were
Christians. The same is true of the spirit in which heretics were
persecuted by the Church. For it was not until the Papacy became a
secular power that it began to persecute heretics, while the most active
in their persecutions were the great Popes rather than the average ones,
and all the great Popes, as Mr. McCabe points out,<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11" role="doc-noteref"><sup>11</sup></a>
were canonists rather than theologians. Such persecutions, however, did
not necessarily involve the death penalty, which was reserved for the
very exceptional and obstinate cases; for, generally speaking, the
opinion prevailed among influential ecclesiastics that while the civil
arm might be employed to deal with heretics by prohibiting assemblies
and in other ways preventing them from spreading their views, the death
penalty was contrary to the spirit of the Gospel. And this attitude
continued until the close of the twelfth century, when, owing to the
spread of the heresy of the Albigenses (which, owing to the support of
the nobility of Southern France, presented the aspect of a powerful
political party in addition to that of an heretical sect), the attitude
of the Church changed. The Church was terribly afraid of this new
spirit, which she considered not only menaced her own existence but the
very foundations of society as well, and in the end she shrank from no
cruelty that she might be rid of it for ever. The persecution of the
Albigenses was the great crime of the Middle Ages, but it is interesting
to observe that Innocent III, who instigated the persecution, was a
canonist rather than a theologian.</p>

</section>
<p>Sufficient has now been said to demonstrate that the suppression of
heresy was undertaken for social rather than religious reasons; because
men felt that the promotion of ideas which destroyed the unity of the
Faith was subversive of the social order. As to whether they were right
in supposing that force was the remedy is quite another matter. But this
much is certain: that men in the past were right in regarding the
preservation of the common mind as a matter of supreme and fundamental
importance to the stability of society; while it is equally certain that
any solution of our difficulties at the present day involves its
recovery; for if order is to be restored to the world, it will have to
make its appearance first in the mind of man. And if order is to make
its appearance in the mind of man, it will be because the world returns
to Christianity. In the break-up of the modern world Christianity is the
one thing that is left standing. Its principles are still vaguely
accepted by an enormous mass of people to-day, and that is why it must
become the new centre of order—a rallying point from which the
traditions of society, of a common mind, can be re-created.</p>
<p>But it will be said: If we are to wait until a revival of
Christianity is an accomplished fact we are lost, for the problem
confronting society develops with such rapidity, and we cannot expect
any wholesale conversions of men to Christianity. To which I answer that
I am speaking of the ultimate solution, not of immediate measures. But
it would clarify our thinking enormously about practical measures if we
considered them in the light of Christianity instead of in the light of
the materialist philosophy. It is for this reason that the formulation
and popularisation of a definitely Christian sociology which would
relate the principles and forms of social organisation to the principles
of Christianity is a matter of urgency. For in this our immediate task
of re-creating the common mind, we cannot rely upon any purely
educational propaganda which would aim direct at the creation of common
standards of thought and morals; for such a propaganda would lack the
definiteness necessary to the crystallisation of thought. It is for this
reason that there remains but one path of approach—to approach the
spiritual through the material. We must meet the public half-way,
bringing light to bear upon the problems in which they are interested,
tackling the concrete realities of life and society. By such means the
principles of Christianity would be brought into a close and definite
relationship with the thought of to-day. And from the union would be
born a common mind.</p>
</section>
<section id="vii.-the-church-and-brotherhood" class="level1">
<h1>VII. The Church and Brotherhood</h1>
<p>We saw that from a sociological point of view the first function of
the Church is to maintain in society common standards of thought and
morals; its second is to promote the brotherhood of mankind. These two
functions necessary to the establishment of the Kingdom of God upon
earth correspond respectively to the two great commandments of the law
upon which Jesus asserted “hang all the law and the prophets.”</p>
<p>The parallel is identical. For the common mind and the brotherhood of
man are as mutually dependent upon each other as we saw the commandments
to love God and to love one’s neighbour are mutually dependent. They are
mutually dependent because if men are to share a common life they must
share a common mind, while if they are finally to share a common mind
they must share a common life, for anything that is destructive of the
one reacts to destroy the other. Heresies destroy the common life by
destroying the common mind, while capitalism destroys the common mind by
destroying the common life. Such considerations enforce the conclusion
that neither of these ideas is intelligible apart from the other. We
have considered what is meant by the common mind; we must now proceed to
consider what is meant by the common life or the brotherhood of man.</p>
<p>As at the present time popular ideas about brotherhood are so vague
and nebulous, it will clear the air of a great deal of cant if we begin
by saying what it is not. And in this connection it is to be observed
that the brotherhood of man is not going to be promoted by crying ”
Peace, peace, where there is no peace.” Brotherhood does not mean
bringing all and sundry together, people who share different traditions,
exploiters and exploited, and demanding that they shall live henceforth
in peace and amity in the sloppy-minded sentimental way so many
Christian bodies set to work. For brotherhood must be based upon
justice, and attempts to evade the great fundamental injustices of our
civilisation do not bring brotherhood nearer, but postpone it. To ask
the poor to recognise their exploiters as brothers while they are still
unrepentant is to insult them, for such advice, if followed, would rob
them of what honour they have left. For there can be no forgiveness
without repentance. Activity of this kind has done incalculable harm to
the cause of Christianity, for we may be perfectly assured Jesus would
have no sympathy with action of such an invertebrate character. If He
commanded men to love another, He also said: “Think not I come to bring
peace but a sword.” If He did not preach class hatred, He did attack the
ideal of wealth, not only because it involved injustice to the poor, but
because of its evil effect on the character of the rich. Pride and
avarice, the two sins associated with wealth, are the two great enemies
of the brotherhood of man. They separate a man from his fellows, cutting
him off from the great currents of love and fellowship, from the great
primary realities of life, causing him to live an artificial life. If a
man is whole hearted in his pursuit of wealth and sacrifices everything
to it, he ends in becoming an empty husk from which all the sweetness
has gone. And in this state he comes to crave sensation and becomes a
prey to luxury, vice, and pleasure, which he pursues to relieve his
boredom.</p>
<p>That is the great peril of wealth. And it was because Jesus saw that
there were two sides of the question, inasmuch as it brought evil into
the lives of both the rich and the poor, that He did not preach class
hatred, but attacked the ideal of wealth. He did not preach class hatred
because He saw that by increasing antagonisms it would postpone rather
than hasten the arrival of human brotherhood. For hatred only breeds
hatred; it does not bring fellowship and love. Jesus saw that the social
problem was not merely a material question of redistributing wealth and
property, but a spiritual one of changing the ideal of men. And it was
necessary that the ideal be changed first, because any redistribution of
wealth apart from it would not be permanent; since as long as men
worshipped wealth in their hearts, the same social and economic evils
would soon reappear if a new social order were established, were such a
thing possible.</p>
<p>It was because Jesus saw that the evils of wealth had their roots in
the hearts of men that He preached repentance. Repentance was the first
step because it meant a change of spirit, and this was a precedent
condition of material change. If men come to love God in His Person or
in His Substance, their lives would be filled with something that would
make them indifferent to wealth. They would be lifted on to a higher
plane. And on this higher plane they would see wealth for what it is.
They could use it, and its use would be good. For being proof against
its temptations it could not enslave them. Thus we see that Socialists,
in concentrating entirely on the material side of the social problem
whilst ignoring the spiritual, are mistaken. It is true that the
existing system of industry gives rise to all manner of evils, that
sweating, overcrowding, unemployment, shoddy work, adulteration,
profiteering, lying, fraud, and a thousand and one other evils are
promoted by it. And to this extent the average man to-day is very much
the victim of circumstances. But it is not the whole truth. For on the
other hand it is equally true to say that the present system, with all
its vices, is the creation of man; that it is a manifestation of the
evil in the heart of man; of the active pursuit of avarice by some men,
and a passive acquiescence in it by most men. And it is for this reason
that it is vain to suppose that the brotherhood of man can be promoted
merely by a change of environment. Nay, it is because of this that it is
impossible by means of external reform considered apart from a change of
heart to change for the better the environment at all, as the failure of
Socialist measures everywhere abundantly testifies.</p>
<p>Among the lessons that are to be learned from the Socialist failure,
there are two which have an immediate bearing on the point we are
discussing. The first of these is that capitalism will not yield to a
frontal attack, and must therefore be undermined; and the other is that
the realisation of brotherhood can only follow a change in the spirit of
men. Brotherhood is fellowship, and fellowship has its basis in
friendship. It has its origin in groups of friends who are united in
common aims and sympathies; and the brotherhood of man can only follow
the gradual expansion of such fellowships. It must begin with the
details of life, with neighbourly actions. The Mediaeval Guilds were
fellowships. The word “Guild” originally meant a festival or sacrificial
feast, and was applied subsequently to the company who thus feasted
together. And it would be well if some of our organisations would revive
this Mediaeval custom, as has already been done by the Adult Schools
with their Sunday morning breakfasts. Fellowship appears to be
indissolubly connected with the taking of meals in common. For this
reason it is necessary to insist that brotherhood is not primarily a
method of organisation, but a way of life. It is true that as it
develops it needs to be supported by organisation, nevertheless the fact
remains that it is primarily a <em>life</em>, which aspect we must
to-day be always insisting upon; for the fundamental importance of this
aspect is almost completely lost sight of in Socialist economics.<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12" role="doc-noteref"><sup>12</sup></a></p>

</section>
<p>In the Middle Ages these things were understood because the
brotherhood of man then reposed upon the Fatherhood of God. It was this
association of the ideal of brotherhood with that of religion that kept
its essentially human basis in the forefront of people’s minds. But with
the break-up of the Middle Ages, accompanied as it was with the decline
in the power and influence of the Church, the defeat of the Guilds and
the formation of great States, and the subsequent rise of rationalism,
the essentially human and religious basis of brotherhood was lost sight
of; and men came to think of society and social arrangements in the
terms of politics rather than religion, in the belief that reform of the
State rather than of the Church was the key to the situation. And so it
came about that with the French Revolution the ideal of brotherhood
became associated with political activity, and the State was called upon
to re-create what it had assisted to destroy. And it has remained
associated with political or industrial activity ever since, with the
result that the very conception of brotherhood has been changed from an
idea resting on a spiritual basis to an idea resting on a material one,
from an idea which concerned itself primarily with the relation of man
to man to an idea which concerns itself primarily with the relation of
man to his environment. Not that the latter is unimportant, but that the
Socialist in always stressing the need of a change in environment while
ignoring the still more important need of a change in spirit, has in
thought moved farther and farther away from the ideal of brotherhood, as
the incessant quarrels and dissensions within the movement abundantly
testify. Confronted by a common enemy in the renewed power of
capitalism, these quarrels have perhaps for the moment somewhat abated.
Yet we may be assured that the truce is but temporary, and that they
will reappear with a change of fortune. For peace is impossible in a
movement which no longer shares a common mind.</p>

<h1>VIII. The Necessity of Law</h1>
<p>The brotherhood of man, expressing itself in communist society, where
all share and share alike and private property is unknown, is the
Christian ideal of society. But such an ideal is not easy of attainment,
for it is only capable of realisation on the assumption that its
individual members will accept a discipline which the majority are not
prepared to do. Hence, while throughout history it has been a tradition
of the Church to uphold the ideal of pure communism as the best form of
organisation for religious orders, a modified communism which we know by
the names of the corporate or common life has been found to be a more
practicable ideal for the life of the workaday world, experience having
taught men that “private property and common use,” rather than “common
property and private use”—to adopt Father Jarrett’s phrase<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13" role="doc-noteref"><sup>13</sup></a>—was more adapted to the
circumstances of secular society.</p>

</section>
<p>But the unwillingness of the average man to accept a discipline is
not the only difficulty that stands in the way of the organisation of
secular society on a basis of pure communism. A greater difficulty
arises from the fact that in every society there is to be found a
minority of men actuated by anti-social motives who spurn the ideal of
brotherhood. There is a type of man whom Señor de Maeztu has designated
the “man of prey,” whose ruling passion is the love of wealth and power
and who is always ready to sacrifice the welfare of others to the
attainment of his ambition. In societies where law is weak, such men
take to plunder and robbery. In modern societies where the law is
strong, it is more usual for them to seek their ends by profiteering and
other usurious dealings, by lying, deceit, and the countless forms of
fraudulent gain whereby men are for ever seeking to gather the riches
which will give them power over others.</p>
<p>It is because of the existence in every community of such anti-social
types of men who cannot be persuaded to respect the claims of the common
life, that law at all times is a necessity. It is necessary to protect
peaceable and honest working citizens from the depredations of the men
of prey ; for if the brotherhood of man is ever to be realised in fact
it can only be on the assumption that laws exist to restrain such men.
For just as bad money drives good out of the market if allowed free
circulation, so high standards of social and commercial life can only be
maintained on the assumption that laws exist to suppress lower ones. But
in our day the State which administers the law has come very much under
the domination of the men of prey, who use it as an instrument for their
purposes; for exploiting the public and the workers or for the
subjugation of other races, while they do not hesitate to plunge the
country on occasion into war to protect their interests. And because
this undoubted fact has in these days received a wide recognition, an
increasing minority of people have come to regard the State as the very
embodiment of evil; as a mere instrument of exploitation; as the enemy
of society; and are busy promoting the idea that there can be no social
salvation until the State as we understand it is abolished, while some
have gone so far as to demand “an unarmed Commonwealth of Friends
trained to live by reason, love and freedom.”<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14" role="doc-noteref"><sup>14</sup></a></p>

<p>Now it does seem to me that at the present time, when all manner of
evil deeds are being done behind our backs in the name of the State,
when we can get no exact knowledge of what is going on, when we can no
longer believe what the newspapers tell us, when, in fact, politics have
become a mere puppet show, the strings of which are pulled by
unscrupulous financiers who think only of deals, and when another war
would probably end in the destruction of civilization, the only possible
attitude is the pacifist one; for the only way to put a stop to such
iniquities is to refuse to support those who commit them. But I do not
think that we are justified in assuming because of the present iniquity
of the State that the State should or could be abolished, or that armed
defence in some form could be entirely dispensed with; for even if
corruption was eradicated from politics and men of principle did come
into power again, they would not be able to retain power for long unless
they took measures to protect themselves against the men of prey by the
enactment of laws in their restraint and were prepared to back them up
if necessary with force; for all law rests ultimately upon force. And
what is true for the maintenance of internal order, of protecting
society against the enemy within the gates, is true for protecting it
against enemies outside. For no society, however well ordered it might
be, however much it stands for righteousness, can be secure against
invasion so long as any people in the world are under the domination of
men of the predatory type. It may be true, as internationalists assert,
that, taken in the mass, men are very much alike all over the world. But
in practical affairs what makes the difference is the type of man that
dominates a civilisation, for the dominating type gives the tone to a
community, and it is that which in politics must be reckoned with.</p>
<p>But the feeling to-day against the State does not only rest on the
pacifist objection to the use of force; for the Communists who believe
in the use of force are equally opposed to it. Their objection is just
as fundamental, for it rests upon the clear apprehension of the fact
that the State has consistently upheld certain evils in society (which
is true), though it should not be forgotten that good influences as well
as bad have been -brought to bear upon the State. Yet, generally
speaking, it is true to say that laws to-day are made <em>to enable rich
men to live among poor</em>, instead of <em>to enable good men to live
among bad</em>, as was the aim of the Mediaeval customary or common
law.<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15" role="doc-noteref"><sup>15</sup></a> And I think it would clear the air
of a great deal of discussion at cross purposes and bring reformers into
a definite relationship with reality if, instead of demanding the
abolition of the State, which is impracticable, and affirming the
natural perfection of mankind, which is untrue, they were to take their
stand on the principle that the aim of all legislation should be to
enable good men to live among bad. At any rate, such a position appears
to me to be the only consistent one for Christians to adopt. Such a
principle is the political expression of the doctrine of original sin;
for the distinction it makes between good men and bad is the practical
one which we make in the world of affairs, and is in no way inconsistent
with an equal recognition of the theological position that all men are
sinners.</p>

<p>The application of such a principle would be revolutionary; for it
would put reformers in a position to steer a safe middle course between
the impracticable and the undesirable, and at the present time the
choice is generally between these alternatives. We miss the significance
of the present intellectual reaction against Socialism if we assume that
it is due to a desire to deny the rightful claims of Labour, since on
the contrary it is due to the realisation of the fact that their actual
proposals are in the larger sense impracticable, and therefore if
applied could only make matters worse than they are at present. It is
for this reason that the recent victory of Labour at the polls can only
be the prelude to another disappointment, for until faith in the
realisability of the confused notions of mid-Victorian Socialism has
been destroyed absolutely root and branch, no sane and reasonable
proposal will be listened to, because such proposals necessarily come
into collision with the dogmas of Socialism, which, approaching every
problem of society from a purely material point of view, puts the
emphasis on the wrong aspect, exalting questions of expediency into
principles while treating other issues which should be determined on
principle as matters of expediency.</p>
<p>In no direction has this wrong approach been followed by such
confusions and contradictions as in the Socialist attitude towards the
State. In the days of Collectivism the State was idealised. Always a
necessity, the State was converted by Collectivists into The Good. This
is no exaggeration; for with them the idea of the State acquired a kind
of ethical value. For every social evil there was one and only one
remedy—apply the magic formula of State control, and evil would be
suddenly transformed into good. It was a pure illusion, and it could not
stand the shock of reality. A few years of activity on a Collectivist
basis led to disillusionment, and from being idealised the State fell
into contempt; from being The Good it became The Bad. This change of
attitude was in operation before the War. But the rapid and enormous
extension of State activity during the War made reaction inevitable. It
brought home to everybody the inadequacy of bureaucracy as a method of
organisation, while the profiteering and corruption which were
associated more particularly with war contracts, the incompetence and
corruption of politicians, and the failure of the Peace has brought
everything connected with the State into contempt. It is not my purpose
to rescue the State from contempt; for in the main I share the opinions
of its critics. But just as I found myself in opposition to those who a
decade or so ago thought the State capable of doing everything much
better than an individual or group of men could do it, so nowadays I
feel myself equally opposed to those who can see nothing but evil in the
State and demand its abolition. Each view appears to me to be equally
irrational. The reaction against the State to-day is in no small measure
due to the fact that Collectivists demanded that it should perform
impossibilities. If the State is not capable of doing all things, it
nevertheless remains the only power capable of doing some things. It is
the only power capable of giving protection—the need of which first
called it into existence. It is capable of securing some measure of
internal order, though it should fail to live up to the ideal of
justice. And the maintenance of order is a function not to be
underrated, as we should soon find out if the State became incapable of
performing it. In the rehabilitated Christendom to which we look
forward, the maintenance of order will be the only function entrusted to
the State. Instead of being the all-powerful Leviathan, the overwhelming
and dominating power it is to-day, it will, stripped of its illegitimate
functions, be reduced to the position it held in the Middle Ages,
becoming one power among a plurality of powers. The old Liberals were
right in maintaining that the less the State did the better ; where they
were wrong was in assuming that for this reason as many activities as
possible should be left to the unrestrained competition of individuals.
For there is a middle course that they lost sight of—the restrained
individualism which existed under the Mediaeval Guilds.</p>
<p>But Collectivists, obsessed with the idea of Progress and full of
prejudices and ignorance in regard to the past, were blind to the
possibilities of a Guild revival. And so they were led to idealise the
State, which they demanded should take over and administer land,
capital, and the means of production and exchange; not understanding
that the State of historical actuality, the highly centralised State of
modern times, is itself a part of or symptom of the disease of society,
and that the remedy is not to be found in the direction of increasing
the already exaggerated abnormality and artificiality of society, but in
the direction of a return to simpler, more normal and wholesome
conditions of life and society, such as existed in the past when men
were held together by personal and human ties and there was little need
of the impersonal activity of the State.</p>

<h1>IX. The Social Organisation of the Middle Ages</h1>
<p>The conclusion at which we arrived in the last chapter—that a
solution of the social problem is not to be found in the direction of an
increase of artificiality but in the direction of a return to simpler
and more wholesome conditions of life and society such as existed in the
past—leads inevitably to a consideration of the social organisation of
the Middle Ages. Moreover, as the institutions of the Middle Ages were
in varying degrees expressions of the spirit of Christianity, they offer
us a pattern that may be studied in the interests of a revival of
Christendom.</p>
<p>However much room there may be for differences of opinion as to the
precise measure of success that followed upon the application of
Mediaeval principles of social organisation, there is no room for doubt
as to what the exact nature of the principles really were. The central
one was that of Function, to which the organisation of the Church, the
monarchy, the feudal system, and the guilds alike conformed. The
principle of Function was defined in the twelfth century by John of
Salisbury as the principle “that a well-ordered constitution consists in
the proper apportionment of functions to members and in the apt
condition, strength and composition of each and every member; that all
members must in their functions supplement and support each other, never
losing sight of the weal of the others, and feeling pain in the harm
that is done to another.” In our day it has been defined by Señor de
Maeztu as the principle which says “that rights ought only to be granted
to men or associations of men in virtue of the function they fulfil, and
not on any pretences of a subjective character,” and as such he
recommends it as an alternative to the principles of liberty and
authority, between which the modern world oscillates. “The liberal
principle,” he asserts, “is no principle at all, because it does not
bind the individual to any kind of solidarity; it leads to incoherence
in the societies in which it prevails. It sanctions all desires,
legitimate and illegitimate, and all opinion founded, and unfounded.”
The principle of authority, on the other hand, he regards as equally
dangerous, because when ” we try to found an order on the omnipotence of
authority instead of deriving authority from the necessity of order, the
result is disorder, because society abandons itself unconditionally to
the ambition of individuals who assume the privileges of authority. And
as ambition in its essence is unlimited, it will not be satisfied with
anything less than the world for a kingdom.”<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16" role="doc-noteref"><sup>16</sup></a></p>

<li id="fn16" role="doc-endnote"><p><em>Authority, Liberty and
Function</em>, by Ramiro de Maeztu.</p>
<p>Mr. Tawney has defined the principle of Function as “an activity
which embodies and expresses the idea of social purpose. The essence of
it is that the agent does not merely perform it for personal gain or to
gratify himself, but recognises that he is responsible for its discharge
to some higher authority.”—<a href="https://cadenhaustein.com/books/acquisitive-society"><em>The
Acquisitive Society</em>, by R. H. Tawney</a>.<a href="#fnref16" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>

</section>
<p>It is because the Mediaevalists acknowledged neither the principles
of authority nor of liberty as they are understood to-day, but this
third principle of Function, which is neither yet partakes of the nature
of both, that the modern mind which thinks in the terms of authority or
liberty, as the case may be, finds it as a rule so difficult to
understand the Middle Ages, and this is why the usual criticism of
Mediaeval institutions is so futile. It is futile because it invariably
postulates the existence of a standard which never did exist, and never
can exist, because it is not in the nature of things to exist. Thus the
institutions of the Middle Ages are maligned, because of the
shortcomings of individuals—it never occurring to such critics that no
kind of social machinery can avert those evils which arise from the
pride, avarice, or quarrelsomeness of human nature. Socialists who
imagine the contrary are living in a world of unrealities. Their search
for a social system that shall be constructed so perfectly that the evil
desires in man will balance and neutralise each other in an equilibrium
of good is as vain as the search for perpetual motion. For laws cannot
be made that will make men go straight in spite of themselves. On the
cont<sup>ar3</sup> the utmost we can demand is that laws and
organisations shall discourage rather than encourage the evil elements
of human nature. Forms of organisation may be designed to enable the
good men to live among bad, but we cannot by means of social
organisation ensure that the good shall prevail in society, for that
depends on the proportion the good men bear to the bad and the amount of
cohesion existing in each camp; while, if the bad are in a majority or
are more united than the good, they will find means of turning the best
of institutions to evil purposes. If, therefore, we praise the social
organisations of the Middle Ages, it is not because we imagine that
crime and dishonesty were absent from Mediaeval society, but because
they existed in spite of the laws and social organisation, and not
because of them. Mediaeval organisations based upon the principle of
Function accepted the idea of reciprocal rights and duties. A man might
enjoy rights, but only on condition that he fulfilled his obligations to
the community, while if he failed in their fulfilment he might lose his
rights. There were no rights in the Middle Ages that were absolute and
unconditional, such as exist to-day.</p>
<p>These principles are common to all Mediaeval organisations. The idea
of Function was central in the Guilds. The Guilds were privileged
bodies, but their privileges were held conditional upon their
performance of public duties. They were granted charters by the State
which gave them a monopoly of a trade over a particular town or city.
But it was not a monopoly which conferred upon them the privilege of
exploiting the community, as is the case with limited liability
companies, but a monopoly to enable the members of a craft to suppress
trade abuses. The guilds were required to uphold the traditions of their
craft, to sell at a just and fixed price, to pay just and fixed wages,
to train apprentices and suppress profiteering in its various forms of
forestalling, regrating, engrossing and adulteration, while they
performed the functions of mutual aid among their members. If a
guildsman was sick, he was visited. If he fell into want, he was
befriended. If he died, his widow and children were provided for out of
the funds of the Guild. Thus in one way or another the Guild entered
into all the details of life. It gave the craftsman security. It
protected him against unscrupulous rivals, while it ensured there should
be fair dealing between him and the public. And with a fine instinct of
sociological truth, the Mediaevalists saw that such things were only
possible on a basis of reciprocal rights and duties.</p>
<p>What was true of the Guilds was true of the Feudal System, for, like
them, it was based upon the principles of Function, with its concomitant
of reciprocal rights and duties. I am aware that this is not the popular
notion, which, basing its ideas of what Feudalism was, upon the
corrupted Feudalism against which the peasants rose in 1381, is entirely
unaware that Feudalism stood for anything but exploitation. This is not
the place to enter into the history of Feudalism, but this much can be
said, that it had a popular origin, beginning as a local system of
military defence to protect the people against the barbarian invasions
of the ninth and tenth centuries, when central government collapsed. But
partly through the crystallising tendency that overtakes all
institutions and partly because it was extended by conquest, it came
through the lapse of centuries to wear a different complexion, and
hardened into a hereditary system of social, economic and military
organisation which affected the life of every class in the community,
from the villain to the king, not excluding the greater part of the
clergy.</p>
<p>Though the romantic representation of Feudalism as dominated by the
sentiment of chivalry may be exaggerated, there can be little doubt that
its animating principle was that of personal loyalty and devotion, since
apart from such sentiments the system could have neither come into
existence, persisted for centuries, nor ended its life in the Crusades.
Yet no society can rest entirely upon sentiment, since in the long run
human relations are impossible apart from some reasonable recognition
and fulfilment of mutual obligations. Thus we find that while the vassal
was bound to discharge certain obligations to his lord, it was only on
condition that the lord discharged his obligations to the vassal.</p>
<p>The principle of mutual obligation was carried into economic
relationships. The serf had to give part of his labour to the lord; but
the amount of labour the lord could exact was a legally defined and
fixed quantity, in return for which the serf received military
protection, which, in those turbulent times, was no small thing. And
what is not generally recognised is that the right to strike was
recognised in Feudal law, for if the lord failed in his duties, men were
absolved from their feudal obligations towards him.</p>
<p>When we pass on to consider the institution of Monarchy, we find the
same acknowledgement of the principle of Function; the same insistence
upon reciprocal rights and duties. The Mediaeval king was not, as
popular opinion supposes, a capricious ruler possessing almost unlimited
authority. On the contrary, he was subject to the law. He held his
authority on the supposition that he would administer justice, while the
right of rebellion against the ruler who abused his position was freely
maintained by all political thinkers of the Middle Ages, and supported
by the Church, which, in those days, was in a position to make things
very unpleasant for any monarch who put himself above the law. Nay, so
far from it being true that the king was a despot exercising unlimited
authority, many of the troubles of the Middle Ages arose from the fact
that he was not possessed of sufficient authority. For kings in those
days did not possess any effective civil service or police to ensure the
smooth working of the law; and here it is to be observed that law in the
Middle Ages did not normally present itself as something to be made, but
was primarily custom which owed its existence to the corporate sense of
the community.</p>
<p>Any new law that was made was not the arbitrary act of the ruler, or
even of an assembly, but in some more or less vague way required the
acceptance of the whole community. On accession it was customary for the
king to swear fidelity to all written and traditional customs, which
henceforth he was empowered to administer. The formal treatises on
kingship, of which there were many in the Middle Ages, were very largely
made up of admonitions to the king to follow after justice and mercy, to
seek wisdom and to fear God. He was to appoint fit persons to administer
the laws under him. But they were not to lord it over the people or
ill-treat them. For this reason the king should always be ready to hear
the cause of the poor himself, lest any of his ministers should act
unjustly or suffer the poor to be oppressed. Only by doing justice to
the poor and the orphan could he hope for God to establish his
throne.</p>
<p>Though it is true to say that the Church acknowledged the same
principle of reciprocal rights and duties—its rights being temporal and
its duties spiritual—yet there is another sense in which this is not
true. The theory and claims of Papal absolutism which at first glance
appear to be so genuinely Mediaeval, really made a breach with the
Mediaeval mode of thought and conception of society, for, as Gierke
insists, the Papacy was the first force to tread the road that leads
away from the Mediaeval to the modern world. And the claims of Papal
absolutism brought in their train other absolutisms—the absolutisms of
States and the Empire and other conceptions of law, of society and the
individual, which between them drew away all the vital nutriment that
fed the Mediaeval social order.</p>
</section>
<section id="x.-why-the-middle-ages-failed" class="level1">
<h1>X. Why the Middle Ages Failed</h1>
<p>We saw that the principle behind the various forms of social
organisation in the Middle Ages which gave to them their peculiar
Christian character was that of Function—of reciprocal rights and
duties; and that in the demands of Papal absolutism was to be found the
beginning of the change which gradually undermined Mediaeval society. It
is necessary for a clear comprehension of the problems of our own times
to consider this important development more in detail. For only when we
know exactly how the modern world with all its evils came into being can
there be any prospect of finding a remedy.</p>
<p>Prior to the quarrel over the Right of Investiture, in the eleventh
century, the relations subsisting between the Papacy and the Empire and
secular authorities had been friendly and sympathetic. But there was a
crying scandal that demanded a remedy—the evil of simony, or the sale of
ecclesiastical offices—which brought in its train worldliness, luxury
and profligacy. It was an evil of long standing, but it was not until
the end of the eleventh century that determined action was taken to find
a remedy, and then it came about as a consequence of the far-reaching
influence of a great spiritual revival that a century earlier had spread
from the abbey of Cluny. In the minds of reformers the scandal of simony
was primarily connected with the predominant influence of kings and
emperors in the higher ecclesiastical appointments which resulted in
such offices being bestowed as payment for secular services rather than
upon men who were controlled by religious principles and devoted to the
interests of the Church. To combat this evil the Papacy, under the
inspiration of the archdeacon Hildebrand (the Pope, Gregory VII), began
to develop the policy of limiting or prohibiting the intervention of
secular authorities in ecclesiastical appointments—a policy which led
immediately to the quarrel over the Right of Investiture, and eventually
to the demand of the Church to control the secular state and make her
counsels the guide of the world.</p>
<p>Around this quarrel there arose a great controversy to determine the
respective spheres of influence of the Popes and the Emperors. In
connection with it, historical investigations were undertaken, which
indirectly had the result of effecting a revival of Roman law, which, as
legal historians have rightly claimed, was an event of the first
importance. “A history of civilisation,” says Maitland, “would be
miserably imperfect if it took no account of the first new birth of
Roman law in the Bologna of Irnerius. Indeed, there are those who think
that no later movement—not the Renaissance, not the Reformation—draws a
stronger line across the annals of mankind than that which was drawn
about the year 1100, when a human science won a place beside
theology.”<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17" role="doc-noteref"><sup>17</sup></a> With the opinion of this
distinguished scholar I entirely agree, though perhaps for a different
reason. For the significance of the revival is to be found in the fact
that Roman law is a very human science—very much more</p>

<p>human than many of its exponents are prepared to admit. The Mediaeval
social order was Christian, and relatively stable because it
acknowledged the principle of reciprocal rights and duties, making the
enjoyment of rights dependent upon the fulfilment of duties. But the
ideas associated with the revival of Roman law gradually changed all
that, for Roman law was as emphatically individualist and capitalist in
spirit as Mediaeval law was communal and corporate. The consequence was
the revival of Roman law drove a wedge between the two aspects of
reciprocity of Mediaeval law, making rights absolute and duties
optional, for under Roman law the rights of private property are the
rights of use and abuse. The legalisation of a principle of such an
anti-social character gradually undermined in the community the sense of
corporate responsibility. It transformed feudalism into landlordism,
justified and legalised usury, while by bringing the idea of the Just
Price into discredit it operated to undermine the Guilds. It was thus
that the revival of Roman law broke up the Middle Ages by opening a road
for the growth of capitalism and individualism. Nor can this charge be
met by pleading that law follows custom, because it so happens that the
Mediaeval jurists who promoted the revival were not mere legalists who
confined their attention to the technicalities of law, but propagandists
who taught a system of morality which justified economic individualism,
and was therefore antipathetic in spirit to everything that Christianity
stood for. By justifying usury and maintaining individual rights, they
undermined the moral sanctions on which the Mediaeval social order
rested, which teaching in its turn, by its social and economic
reactions, brought about a state of things that was favourable to the
reception of Roman law. Nor again is the position tenable of those who
maintain that it was the development of trade with the East which
followed the Crusades that is responsible for the break-up of the Middle
Ages. For if it be true that the development of trade corrupted
Christendom, why, it may be asked, did it not corrupt Islam? There is
only one answer that I can find. In Islam there was no revival of Roman
law.</p>
<p>Had Roman law no other side to recommend it, the attempts of the
Papacy to suppress its study would probably have been successful. But
there was another side of Roman law which had a very direct appeal to
the self-interest of monarchs, for it could be used as a weapon for
resisting the encroachments of the Papacy. The Mediaeval king found
himself placed between two kinds of law. There was on one side of him
the Canon law of the Church, which had many things to say about the
duties of kingship that were not always acceptable; while on the other
side there was the Feudal law and the Common or Customary law of the
land to which he had to swear fealty. Both of these systems of law were
a source of annoyance to him. For while the former made him subject to
the power of the Church, the latter placed him very much at the mercy of
his barons. Remembering these things, it can occasion no surprise that a
system of law which made law dependent upon the will of the sovereign,
clothing him with unlimited power and supreme authority, should have had
a very strong appeal for monarchs who were faced with the problem of
building up an administrative system powerful enough to counteract the
unruly elements in Feudalism on the one hand, and of maintaining their
position against the absolutist demands of the Papacy on the other. It
was the need of the latter especially that secured a foothold in affairs
for Roman law; for it was first used by the Emperors as a weapon against
the Canon law in ecclesiastical-politico disputes; while the fact that
the study of Roman law brought into existence a trained body of laymen
who were capable of taking office enabled kings to free themselves from
their dependence on clerical advisers who, because of their monopoly of
education, had hitherto been able to monopolise the offices of State.
This was an important factor in the situation at a time when the triumph
of the Papacy had in turn brought into existence national movements to
limit the power of the Popes because they had abused their privilege of
patronage by placing foreigners in the higher ecclesiastical offices of
all lands. It was immediate considerations of this kind that in the
first instance led to the adoption of Roman law and allowed all the
anti-social doctrines associated with it to grow up unobserved under the
royal protection. The truth about Roman law is that it came into
existence to hold together a Pagan society that had been honeycombed
with corruption and rendered unstable by the growth of capitalism, and
it was because Roman law presupposed the existence of a commercial
community that its revival in the Middle Ages operated to introduce into
Mediaeval society the elements of corruption with which it had been
associated in Rome. This is true in spite of the fact that the Roman
jurists of the Empire were men of wide and humane sympathies who did
their best to humanise slavery and the other institutions with which
they had to deal. Unable to conceive the practical possibility of
realising the ideal of justice, they addressed themselves to the more
immediately practical and less ambitious task of maintaining order,
which they achieved by disregarding moral issues, by inculcating always
the policy of following the line of least resistance, by giving legal
sanction and security to private property (no matter by what means it
had been obtained) as the easiest way of avoiding continual strife among
neighbours, and by establishing a supreme power in order to enforce the
fulfilment of contracts. It is this opportunist spirit of Roman law
which for ever exalts considerations of expediency above those of
principle that is at the same time the secret of its power and its
corrupting influence, and explains why its revival proved itself so
fatal to the Mediaeval social order.</p>
<p>But, it will be said, such an explanation of the break-up of the
Mediaeval social order is irrelevant so far as England is concerned,
because there is no Roman law in England. But is this so? It is true
that there has not been in England any formal reception of Roman law
such as happened on the Continent. English law is a continuous tradition
since the Middle Ages. English jurists never fell into the error of
attempting to appropriate the law of another race and to galvanise it
into a semblance of life. Law has never been administered in this
country out of Justinian’s law books, as it was in Germany until the
year 1900. But can we on this account say that there is no Roman law in
England? Feudalism has been replaced by landlordism in which property
rights are absolute and not conditional upon the fulfilment of duties;
usury is legalised; speculation in prices is permitted; contracts are
enforced; the highly centralised State exists among us while corporate
bodies are still treated with suspicion and some hostility. How, we may
ask, have all these things so different from what existed in the Middle
Ages come about? What influence, may we ask, has been at work to bring
about changes in the law of England which correspond so closely to the
changes that followed the reception of Roman law in other countries, if
there is no Roman law in England? For if the contention of the legal
profession be correct, we are entitled to some explanation of this
extraordinary phenomenon that has taken place, and which admits of only
one possible explanation: that though there has not been in this country
any formal reception of Roman law, it is nevertheless a fact that the
concepts of Roman law have taken possession of the Common law, gradually
moulding it until it approximates substantially to the same thing. -At
any rate, this is a reasonable explanation when considered in
conjunction with the fact that Roman law has been taught at Oxford since
the early part of the twelfth century. For it is impossible to believe
that the legal profession has been entirely uninfluenced by its
training. And further, I would submit that the reason why the legal
profession enjoys the illusion that there is no Roman law in England is,
on the one hand, due to the fact that the broad moral issue is for it
obscured by considerations of technicalities, and on the other that it
thinks of Roman law entirely in the terms of the Reception, which it
identifies entirely with the issue of absolute monarchy. But if the
movement for a reception and absolute monarchy was defeated in the
seventeenth century, may it not be that something as bad, if not worse,
has happened? Law in this country may not be dependent on the pleasure
of the ruler, but for a long time it has been dependent on the pleasure
of an oligarchy of landlords and capitalists, though the reality may be
concealed under the forms of democracy. And though at times a despot may
act disinterestedly, an oligarchy never does.</p>
<p>But it is not necessary for me to labour this point any longer, for
nowadays it is admitted by at least one legal authority that such a
transformation of English law has taken place. In the recent edition of
<em>Stephen’s Commentaries of the Laws of England</em>, the general
editor, Professor Jenks, discusses the question, “How far is the Common
law a native system?” suggesting that it is necessary for the legal
profession to reconsider its commonly received opinion that there is no
Roman law in England, in connection with which he says:—</p>
<p>“It is at least worthy to note that the plunder of the Guilds
(sanctioned in the statute of 1547) coincided very closely, as a great
legal historian has shown us, with the last systematic and determined
attempt to seat Roman law openly and avowedly on the Common law.</p>
<p>“It may well be therefore that the final verdict of history will hold
that, despite the ostentatious repudiation of the ‘Romanists’ by the
founders of the Common law, there yet entered into the framework of that
law much material indirectly derived from Roman law. Certainly nothing
could in appearance and detail be much more remote from Roman principles
than that system of feudal land-tenure which was the most striking and,
in some ways, the most permanent result of the Norman Conquest.
Nevertheless the system which converted the thegn or <em>land-rica</em>
into the feudal landowner, whose villagers became his serfs and held
their land ‘at the will of the lord,’ who could turn the village waste
into a capitalist sheep-run, who could treat his land, by sale and
mortgage, as an article of commerce, who could ultimately break up the
whole system of communal farming by ‘enclosures,’ was far more in
sympathy with the individual ownership and capitalist principles of the
Roman law than with the strong communal instincts of pre-Conquest
agricultural customs.”<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18" role="doc-noteref"><sup>18</sup></a></p>

<p>Hitherto what we have said about Roman law has been about the <em>jus
civile</em> or Civil law. But it is equally necessary to any
comprehension of history or the social problem to understand the part
played by the theory of the <em>jus naturale</em> or Law of Nature,
which we must now proceed to consider. For, as Herr Beer rightly points
out, “the influence exercised by that theory, or system of thought, in
the development of English, and generally, European social and political
speculations, could hardly be over-estimated. Schoolmen, theologians,
statesmen, lawyers, revolutionists and poets based their reasoning and
wove their imaginings on it, and even as late as in the first half of
the nineteenth century… British socialists, poor law and social
reformers were thinking in the terms of that system.”<a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20" role="doc-noteref"><sup>20</sup></a></p>

<p>What, then, was the theory of the Law of Nature? It might, perhaps,
be defined as the apologetic for Roman Civil Law, being designed to give
philosophic justification to its measures of practical expediency. The
Civil Law, we saw, had made the attainment of order rather than the
realisation of justice the object of its ambition. In consequence it had
become in Rome an object of suspicion. We learn from Cicero that it was
a common saying of the time that injustice was necessarily involved in
the administration of the Commonwealth. The opinion prevailed that there
was no such thing as justice, or else that justice is mere foolishness,
since the only source of virtue is human agreement—an opinion probably
deriving from Epicurus, who had said that “justice was nothing in
itself, but merely a compact of expediency to prevent mutual injury.”
The Roman jurists, who apparently were of more liberal sentiments, do
not appear to have been altogether happy about the prevailing opinion.
For though they were well aware that the Civil Law was based entirely
upon considerations of expediency, they yet felt in some way law should
be related to the more general and universal principles of justice. And
so it came about that they were led to borrow an idea from the
philosophy of the Stoics which postulated the existence of a natural
condition of society anterior to the formation of States in which men
were free and equal and the principles of justice obtained, and which
they came to recognise as the Law of Nature in contradistinction to the
Civil Law and the <em>jus gentium</em> or Law of Nations which, making
order rather than justice their aim, legalised dominion and
servitude.</p>
<p>The Law of Nature was never at any time a theory resting upon
ascertained fact, but a hypothesis formulated for the purpose of
distinguishing between the ideal and the actual, the primitive and the
conventional, though the grounds of the distinction remained somewhat
uncertain. Each writer gave his own interpretation as</p>
<p>to what constituted the Law of Nature, and because of this during the
course of centuries it became a changing hypothesis, adapting itself to
changing mental and social conditions. At the beginning the Law of
Nature was combined with the Law of Nations; but later jurists realised
the inconsistency. According to the Institutes of Justinian, the Law of
Nature is that which nature teaches animals and men; from it originates
the joining together of male and female, the procreation and education
of the offspring. It is the law which makes air and water free, and
public and religious buildings a common possession, while, as under it
all men are born free and equal, it is incompatible with the institution
of slavery.</p>
<p>Viewed in relation to the Law of Nature, which because of its
universality was considered divine and eternal, the Civil Law was
considered empirical and particular. The Civil Law, it was maintained,
owed its existence to the corruption of human nature which, defeating
the ends of justice, necessitated organised government to keep evil in
check. Thus the State owed its existence to the depravity of human
nature. It was adapted to the circumstances of life, and therefore
justifiable under the actual conditions of society, and for the vices
connected with those conditions it was the true remedy. Or, in other
words, the Civil Law differed from the Law of Nature to the extent that
conventional and civilised life in Rome differed from the natural life
of barbarians, and as such it appears as a kind of Pagan version of the
Fall of Man from the state of innocence he enjoyed in the Garden of
Eden.</p>
<p>Instead of seeking to formulate a system of law in connection with a
theory of sociology to render practicable the establishment of the
Kingdom of God upon earth, the Christian Fathers continued in the
traditions of the Roman jurists. They accepted the distinction the
jurists had made between the ideal and the actual, whilst giving to it a
Christian interpretation. They began by identifying the Law of Nature
with the law of God. All men are by nature equal in the sense that
whether a man be slave or free he is still capable of the same moral and
spiritual life, capable of knowing God and serving Him. To the
institution of slavery, which the jurists held was contrary to nature,
they added the institution of private property. But that did not bring
them into collision with the established social order of Rome, for they
were no more prepared to condemn the institution of property or slavery
as unlawful than were the jurists or the philosophers. On the contrary,
it led them into an attitude of political determinism in which they came
to acquiesce in such institutions because of the Fall; slavery and
property had become a necessity because of the presence of sin in the
world. At the same time, they sought to mitigate their incidence by the
affirmation of the fundamental equality of human nature. If a man was a
slave, he was to be treated fairly and reasonably by his master, who was
no dearer to God than was the slave. If he was a slave-holder, he might
be prevailed upon to free his slaves. If he had wealth, he might be
induced to use it in some public way. But that was as far as they went.
In so far as the spirit of charity, the temper which teaches a man to
put himself on an equality with his fellow-men, tended to modify
existing institutions, the Fathers of the Church may claim to have been
social reformers, but they discouraged all attempts to realise the
Kingdom of God by action of a more positive and radical order.</p>
<p>Now it is not to be denied that, taking all the circumstances of the
time into consideration, a very strong case can be made out for their
attitude. Yet the question remains as to whether, by adopting the
attitude they did, the Christian Fathers did not betray the spirit of
the Gospel. It is a difficult question, and not to be easily answered.
There were extenuating circumstances, and much authority for what they
did. It is necessary in the first place to recognise that, however great
were the evils in Roman society, experience had proved that they would
not yield to a frontal attack. There had been a thousand slave revolts
in antiquity, and one and all had failed. In the next place, we must
remember that the problem of the relation of converts to the Roman
Government was a very difficult one; for the Government not only viewed
the advance of Christianity with distrust and suspicion, but from time
to time adopted a policy of persecution towards it. In the face of such
circumstances the only possible policy for the Fathers to adopt was one
of circumspection. They were not unnaturally anxious to give the
Government no cause for provocation, while it is certain that had the
more impulsive and headstrong among the converts had their own way and
embarked on a revolt that was premature, it would have been defeated and
the success of Christianity might have been imperilled by its
association with revolutionary activities that were foredoomed to
failure. Remembering these things, the conservative attitude of the
Fathers appears as common prudence. We may be assured that they were
absolutely in the right in making it their first aim to change the
temper of society by means of the spread of spiritual truth and in
refusing to compromise themselves by supporting ill-considered revolts.
In adopting this attitude there was, moreover, authority on their side.
Our Lord’s reply to those who asked whether it was lawful to pay tribute
to Caesar clearly showed that He had no intention of becoming entangled
in the difficult questions relating to Jewish nationality and the Roman
Empire, while the fact that St. Paul sent a certain slave Onesimus back
to his master Philemon, from whom he had escaped, leaves no room for
doubt as to what St. Paul thought the attitude of the Church towards
slavery should be. There is no doubt that he thought it should be
dictated by considerations of expediency. “All things are lawful for me;
but all things are not expedient,”<a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21" role="doc-noteref"><sup>21</sup></a> he wrote to the
Corinthians on another occasion and in a different connection. It is
important as testifying to the spirit in which he thought the practical
problems of life should be faced. Idealism was to be tempered by
commonsense.</p>

<p>If the Fathers of the Church had gone no further than to compromise
with slavery, no exception could be taken to their attitude from the
point of view of authority. But it is evident that they did go further.
St. Paul compromised with slavery, but it cannot, I think, be said that
he acquiesced in it. Yet this is what the Fathers did. They acquiesced
in it and justified it. It had become a necessity because of the
presence of sin in the world. And to this fact the decline of the moral
power of Christianity in the fourth century, when it became the official
religion of the Roman Empire, is perhaps to be attributed. A common
explanation for this decline is to say that the moral level went down in
the fourth century, because when Christianity became the official
religion of the Empire it cost nothing to be a Christian, whereas in the
days of persecution it had cost a great deal. No doubt this explanation
is true as far as it goes. But I do not think it is the whole truth; for
it would be a poor testimony to the life-giving powers of the Faith to
say it can only flourish under persecution. I venture, therefore, this
explanation: that, owing to the adoption of the Law of Nature by the
Christian Fathers they had been led into a fatalistic attitude towards
the social question, which resulted in the Church entirely neglecting to
prepare itself by the formulation of a Christian sociology for the
duties that were thrust upon it when at last Christianity obtained the
mastery of government. Belief in the near approach of the Kingdom of God
had been a chief driving force among the Early Christians. It had led to
the most glorious anticipations of what Christianity would do when it
attained supreme power. Yet when at last Christianity became
acknowledged as the official religion of the Roman Empire the great
expectations were not fulfilled. The Church had no new light to throw
upon the problems that confronted society, and this led in the first
instance to disappointment and disillusionment, and finally to
reaction.</p>
<p>The Law of Nature became in the twelfth century an integral part of
the Canon law of the Church. It embodied the definition given by
St. Isidore of Seville in the seventh century. According to him, “the
Law of Nature is common to all nations, and it contains everything that
is known to man by natural instinct and not by constitutions, and
man-made law, and that is: the joining together of man and woman,
procreation and education of children, <em>communis omnium possessio et
omnium una libertas</em>, the acquisition of things that may be captured
in the air, on the earth, and in the water, restitution of loaned and
entrusted goods, finally, self-defence by force against violence.” The
Law of Nature, having become a part of the Canon Law, came to play a
part in the discussions of the schoolmen in the Middle Ages, who
constantly refer to St. Isidore’s definition. At this point an
interesting development takes place. The Law of Nature, as it was
handled by the jurists of the Roman Empire, was, as we saw, a purely
academic proposition, while its influence on patristic thought was to
dispose the Christian Fathers towards an attitude of political
determinism. But when, after the lapse of centuries, interest in the Law
of Nature was revived, it became an instrument of revolutionary
potentialities. The reason for this transformation is to be found in the
circumstances attending the revival of the Roman civil law in the Middle
Ages. In Rome, the Civil Law was the traditional law of the Empire. It
had gradually shaped itself in obedience to considerations of
expediency. If it gave legal sanction to the institution of slavery and
to property rights divorced from duties, it followed custom and merely
gave legal sanction to institutions already existing. But when the Roman
civil law was revived in the Middle Ages, it was different. Slavery,
though it still survived in places, had largely disappeared. Capitalism,
the existence of which the Roman civil law presupposes, was almost
non-existent, if not entirely so; while society did not suffer from a
system of private property as private property was understood in Rome
and as it is understood among us to-day. Hence it was that Roman civil
law, which, in the first instance, gained a lodgment because it was
convenient to monarchs in their quarrels with the Papacy, when given a
wider application appeared as a challenge to mediaeval institutions and
readily lent itself for the purposes of oppression. Armed with it, the
kings found themselves able to encroach upon the functions of the feudal
lords, while the feudal lords in turn found themselves able to encroach
upon the common rights of the people. And so it came about that the land
to which hitherto the peasantry had some share came to be claimed as
private property by the lords, while the peasants began to lose their
ancient status and to sink into a position of slavery. It was against
such encroachments that the peasants rebelled in England in 1381, in
Bohemia in 1521, and in Germany in 1525. And in each case their demand
for the abolition of private property was associated with the Law of
Nature. Thus we see the Peasants’ Revolt and Peasant Wars were in a
theoretical sense a rebellion of the <em>jus naturale</em> of the
peasants and friars against the <em>jus civile</em> of the lawyers and
lords.</p>
<p>With the discovery of America and her tribal organisation, the Law of
Nature acquired an added strength and vigour. Its theory, which hitherto
had appeared as little more than a useful hypothesis, now appeared to
rest on a basis of solid fact. To Amerigo Vespucci, Sir Thomas More,
Hugo Grotius and others the American tribes and communities appeared as
striking demonstrations of the truth of the Law of Nature. From then
onwards it exercised an influence on the development of political
thought and speculation, both English and Continental, that it is
difficult to over-estimate. In the shock of the struggle between
Parliament and Monarchy in the Civil War, the Law of Nature in one form
or another appeared as the main element in the flood of political and
religious heresies that spread over the land. Men no longer appealed to
tradition, to laws and customs, but to reason and the natural rights of
man; to the unwritten law of the <em>jus naturale</em> against the
written law of the <em>jus civile</em>. So full of peril did this
rebellion against all constituted authority appear to many that attempts
were made to reconcile the natural and civil state, and to this end Pope
wrote his <em>Essay on Man</em>, in which he promulgated the view that
the great aim and end of life did not depend on equality of goods and
station, but on virtue, on the rule of reason over passion, on the
harmony between self-love and society, on the identification of
individual and social interests. But such attempts at reconciliation
were in vain, for they became ipso facto apologies for the existing
social order, and as the Civil Law remained in the hands of the
landlords as an instrument for encroaching upon the common rights of the
people, and as they kept on encroaching all attempts at reconciliation
were finally impossible. Political thinkers continued to base their
theories upon the supposed truth of the Law of Nature, until at last, in
the French Revolution, the attempt was made on a truly heroic scale to
establish a new civilisation on the basis of its principles. But the
French Revolution failed, as was inevitable. For a civilisation based
upon the principles of the Law of Nature is a contradiction in terms,
inasmuch as the aim of civilisation is to escape from nature and not to
return to it. Its failure was, among other things, followed by a decline
of faith in the efficacy of the <em>jus naturale</em>, though as a part
of the general political consciousness it still continues to exercise
influence, as the survival of the belief in Free Trade and the demand of
Socialists for the abolition of the private ownership of property bear
witness.</p>
<p>Considering how the <em>jus naturale</em> was in the past associated
with revolutionary activities, it might be supposed that it was the
natural remedy for the injustices of the <em>jus civile</em>. Yet when
we look into the matter more closely we begin to see that the Law of
Nature and the Civil Law are but two aspects of the same disease,
inasmuch as they bring to each other mutual support. Indignation and
attempts to resist the encroachments of landlords armed with the Civil
Law there were bound to be. At this point the Law of Nature comes to the
rescue of the Civil Law, and by filling the minds of the people with
impossible ideals safely steers the popular movements clear of concrete
grievances, causing them to dissipate their energies in wild talk and
popular demonstrations which accomplish nothing, for by leading the
people to demand everything they end in getting nothing. In all the
popular movements that have arisen to demonstrate against landlordism
the demand has never been made to abrogate the Statute of Merton (1235)
which is the foundation of the law on the subject, and which gave to the
lords the right to “make their profit” of the “wastes, woods and
pastures,” notwithstanding the “complaints of knights and freeholders.”
It is because this law is still on the Statute Book that proprietors of
manorial rights continue to encroach to this day. Yet, instead of the
efforts of reformers being concentrated on such a concrete injustice,
they take refuge in economic abstractions, and for this misdirection of
reform activity we have to thank the attitude of mind fostered by the
Law of Nature.</p>
<p>But this is not all that is to be said. Throughout history the Law of
Nature has been responsible for concentrating the attention of reformers
on the problem of property to the exclusion of the problem of currency;
and in our day the problem of machinery. So it has happened that while
in times of revolution the peasant has been able to improve his position
by getting hold of the land, no such benefits have accrued to the town
worker. For the problems of the town worker are more particularly those
of currency and machinery, and on these problems reformers to-day, true
to the traditions of the Law of Nature, have nothing to say.</p>

<section id="xii.-currency-and-the-guilds" class="level1">
<h1>XII. Currency and the Guilds</h1>
<p>It is a commonly received opinion that gains some support from the
theory of Roman law that civilisation owes its existence to the
introduction of slavery. Such a view, however, is untenable. It receives
no support from the actual facts, for we know that slavery existed long
before civilisation came into existence. Not slavery, but the
introduction of currency was the decisive factor in the situation; and
it is the failure to understand this fact that is one of the root causes
of confusion in social theory. It cannot fail to strike the impartial
observer as an extraordinary thing that currency, to the introduction of
which civilisation owes its very existence, should have no recognised
place in social theory. Yet such is the case. Its problems, which are
central in civilisation, are treated as the mere technical ones of
bankers and financiers, and are only approached from their point of
view. But the bankers’ approach is most demonstrably a fundamentally
false one; for it ignores the moral issue involved in the problem of
usury, and it is because the moral factor is ignored in discussions of
this problem that the whole subject is involved in such hopeless
confusion. For currency, Uke every other social and economic problem, to
be intelligible must be approached historically in the light of a
definite moral standard, and not as being a purely technical question
for men who are familiar with the intricacies of finance.</p>
<p>Currency was first introduced in the seventh century before Christ,
when the Lydian kings introduced stamped bars of fixed weight to replace
the metal bars of unfixed weight which hitherto had served as a medium
of exchange. It was a simple device the consequences of which were
entirely unforeseen; but the developments that followed upon it were
simply stupendous. It created an economic revolution comparable only to
that which followed the invention of the steam engine in more recent
times. Civilisation—that is, the development of the material accessories
of life—dates from that simple invention; for by facilitating exchange
it made possible differentiation of occupation, specialisation in the
crafts and arts, city-life and foreign trade. But along with the
undoubted advantages which a fixed currency brought with it, there came
an evil unknown to primitive society—the economic problem. For the
introduction of currency not only undermined the common life of the
Mediterranean communities, but it brought into existence the problem of
capitalism. And with capitalism there came the division of society into
two distinct and hostile classes—the prosperous landowners, merchants
and money-lending class on the one hand, and the peasantry and debt
slaves on the other, while incidentally it gave rise to the private
ownership of land, which now for the first time could be bought and sold
as a commodity.<a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22" role="doc-noteref"><sup>22</sup></a></p>

</ol>
</section>
<p>The reason for these developments is not far to seek. So long as the
exchange was carried on by barter a natural limit was placed to the
development of trade, because under such circumstances people would only
exchange wares for their own personal use. Exchange would only be
possible when each party to the bargain possessed some article of which
the other party was in need. But with the introduction of currency
circumstances changed, and for the first time in history there came into
existence a class of men who bought and sold entirely for the purposes
of gain. These merchants or middlemen became specialists in finance.
They knew better than the peasantry the market value of things, and so
they found little difficulty in taking advantage of them. Little by
little they became rich and the peasantry their debtors. It is the same
story wherever men are at liberty to speculate in values and exchange is
unregulated—the distributor enslaves the producer. It happened in
Greece, it happened in Rome, and it has happened everywhere in the
modern world, for speculation in exchange brings in its train the same
evils.</p>
<p>Though the Greeks and Romans thought a great deal about the economic
problems that had followed the introduction of currency, to the end the
problem eluded them. The ideal of Plato of rebuilding society anew on
the principles of justice gave way to the more immediately practical aim
of the Roman jurists of maintaining order. For, as I have previously
pointed out, the maintenance of order rather than justice was the aim of
Roman law, and as such it was an instrument for holding together a
society that had been rendered unstable by the growth of capitalism.
Thus we see there is a definite connection between the development of
Roman civil law and the inability of antiquity to find a solution for
the problems of currency. Freedom of exchange having led to capitalism,
and capitalism to social disorders, Roman law stepped into the breach,
and by legalising injustices sought to preserve order. And because of
this, because of the generally received opinion in Rome that injustice
was necessarily involved in the administration of the commonwealth, the
jurists of the Antonine period came to postulate the Law of Nature in
order to provide a philosophic basis for their legal measures of
practical necessity. And as reform activities have ever since the Middle
Ages been influenced by the Law of Nature, we see that the vicious
circle in which they move owes its existence to the general failure to
give to the problem of currency its position of central importance.</p>
<p>Unregulated currency gradually disintegrated the civilisations of
Greece and Rome, and mankind had to wait until the Middle Ages before a
solution was -forthcoming, when it was provided by the Guilds in the
light of the teaching of Christianity, though owing to the fact that the
Guilds came into existence as spontaneous and instinctive creations of
the people, their significance was entirely overlooked by Mediaeval
thinkers, who, if orthodox, confined their social and political
speculations to the range of issues covered by the Civil and Canon Laws,
and, if revolutionary, to the issues raised by the Law of Nature, in
neither of which systems Guilds found a place. This was one of the
tragedies of the Middle Ages. For in organising the Guilds the townsmen
of the Middle Ages unconsciously stumbled upon the solution of the
problem of currency, but owing to the fact that the minds of thinkers
and publicists of the time were engrossed with other things the social
potentialities of this great discovery were lost to the world.</p>
<p>What, then, was the solution provided by the Guilds? It was to
stabilise currency by the institution of a Just and Fixed Price. The
Just Price had a central place in Mediaeval economic theory, though,
strictly speaking, the Just Price is a moral rather than an economic
idea. The Mediaevalists understood what we are only beginning to
understand—that there is no such thing as a purely economic solution of
the problems of society, since economics are not to be understood as a
separate and detached science considered apart from morals. On the
contrary, economic issues are primarily moral issues with economic
equivalents. And for this reason Mediaevalists insisted upon things
being bought and sold at a Just Price. They taught that to buy a thing
for less or sell a thing for more than its real value was in itself
unallowable and unjust, and therefore sinful, though exceptional
circumstances might at times make it permissible. The institution of
buying and selling was established for the common advantage of mankind,
but the ends of justice and equality were defeated if one party to any
transaction received a price that was more and the other less than an
article was worth.</p>
<p>This doctrine—that wares should be sold at a Just Price—together with
another—that the taking of interest was sinful—was insisted upon by the
Church, and obedience was enforced from the pulpit, in the confessional,
and in the ecclesiastical courts. So effectually were these doctrines
impressed upon the consciences of men that their principles found their
way into all the secular legislation of the period, whether of
Parliament, Guild or Municipality. The differing fortunes that followed
these legislative attempts to secure obedience to the principle of the
Just Price is instructive, for it demonstrates the undoubted superiority
of the Guild as an instrument for the performance of economic functions.
Parliament could do nothing but enact laws against profiteering, and as
such its action was negative and finally ineffective. But the Guilds
were positive. They sought to give effect to the principle of the Just
Price by making it at the same time a Fixed Price, and around this
central idea there was gradually built up the wonderful system of
corporate life of the cities. Thus, in order to perform their economic
functions, the Guilds had to be privileged bodies, having a complete
monopoly of their trades over the area of a particular town or city; for
only through the exercise of authority over its individual members could
a Guild enforce a discipline. Profiteering and other trade abuses were
ruthlessly suppressed; for the first offence a member was fined; the
most severe penalty was expulsion from the Guild, when a man lost the
privilege of following his trade or craft in his native city.</p>
<p>But a Just and Fixed Price cannot be maintained by moral action
alone. If prices are to be fixed throughout industry, it can only be on
the assumption that a standard of quality can be upheld. As a standard
of quality cannot be defined in the terms of law, it is necessary, for
the maintenance of a standard, to place authority in the hands of
craft-masters, a consensus of whose opinion constitutes the final court
of appeal. In order to ensure a supply of masters it is necessary to
train apprentices, to regulate the size of the workshop, the hours of
labour, the volume of production, and so forth; for only when attention
is given to such matters is it possible “to ensure the permanency of
practice and continuity of tradition, whereby alone the reputation of
the Guild for honourable dealing and sound workmanship can be carried on
from generation to generation,” and conditions created favourable to the
production of masters. Thus we see all the regulations–as, indeed, the
whole hierarchy of the Guild—arising out of the primary object of
maintaining the Just Price.</p>
<p>But it will be said: If the Mediaeval Guilds were such excellent
institutions, why did they disappear? The immediate cause is to be found
in the fact that they were not co-extensive with society. The Guilds
existed in the towns, but they never came into existence in the rural
areas. That was the weak place in the Mediaeval economic armour; for it
is obvious that if a Fixed Price was finally to be maintained anywhere,
it would have to be maintained everywhere, both in town and country.
That Guilds were never organised in the rural areas is to be explained
immediately by the fact that in the eleventh and twelfth centuries, when
Guilds were organised in the towns, the agricultural population was
organised under Feudalism, and money was only beginning to be used, so
the problem was not pressing. But the ultimate reason is to be found in
the fact that the impossibility of maintaining, in the long run, a Just
Price that was not a Fixed Price was not at the time appreciated by the
Church, which appears to have been blind to the need of Guild
organisation for its maintenance. Churchmen then thought, as so many do
to-day, that the world can be redeemed by moral action alone, never
realising that a high standard of commercial morality can only be
maintained if organisations exist to suppress a lower one. Hence it came
about that, when in the thirteenth century the validity of the Just
Price came to be challenged by the lawyers, who maintained the right of
every man to make the best bargain he could for himself, the moral
sanction on which the maintenance of the Just Price ultimately rested
was undermined. Belief in it lost its hold on the country population,
and then the Guild regulations came to be regarded as unnecessary
restrictions on the freedom of the individual. Thus a way was opened in
rural areas for the growth of capitalism and speculation, and this made
it increasingly difficult for the Guilds to maintain fixed prices in the
towns, until at last, in the sixteenth century, the whole system broke
down amid the economic chaos that followed the suppression of the
monasteries and the wholesale importation of gold from South America,
which doubled prices all over Europe. It was because the Guilds were
unable to perform any longer the functions that brought them into
existence that they finally fell, and not because of the Chantries Act
of 1547. This Act did not attack the Guilds as economic organisations,
as is commonly supposed, nor did it seek to confiscate the whole of
their property, but only such part of their revenues as had already been
devoted to specified religious purposes.</p>
<p>The explanation I have given of the decline of the Guilds is, so far
as the details are concerned, the history of the decline of the English
Guilds only. On the Continent the decline pursued a different course,
and as the factors in the situation were there much more complex, it is
not so easy to generalise. Nevertheless, I think it is true to say that
the ultimate cause of their decline is to be traced to the revival of
Roman law. The Guilds went down not because they were unfitted by their
nature to grapple with the problems of a wider social intercourse, as
historians have too hastily assumed, but because the moral sanctions on
which they rested had been completely undermined by the revival of a
system of law that gave legal sanction to usury and permitted
speculation in prices. Unfortunately, the truth of the matter, which is
extremely simple, has been concealed from the public by a mysterious
habit of economic historians of always talking about the growth of
national industry when what they really mean is the growth of capitalist
industry. If they talked about the growth of capitalist industry,
everyone would understand that the failure of the Guilds was a
consequence of the moral failure of Mediaeval society, for the issues
would be clear. But instead of talking about capitalist industry, they
talk about national industry, and people are led to suppose that the
Guilds declined because their type of organisation became obsolete,
which is not the case, as we shall see later.</p>

<h1>XIII. The Just and Fixed Price</h1>
<p>The question of price is as central in the economic situation of
to-day as it was in the Middle Ages, though its importance has been
obscured by the Socialist and Labour movements, whose theories of late
years have almost monopolised public interest. Yet if we turn from what
reformers are talking about to what the business world is thinking
about, we shall find that the problem of price is what engages their
unceasing attention, as the perennial interest in the controversy
between Free Trade and Protection bears witness. Though the economists
of the Manchester School entirely repudiated the conclusions of the
Mediaeval economists, they nevertheless agreed with them that the
problem of price was a central issue. Adam Smith would have agreed with
St. Thomas Aquinas that the attainment of the Just Price was the aim of
economic justice, the difference between them would be on the issue as
to how such a desideratum was to be brought about. Adam Smith, regarding
economics as a detached service unrelated to morals, thought the
advantage of buyer and seller would be best secured by allowing the
prices to be determined by competition; that is, by allowing free play
for the operation of economic forces more or less mechanical. To this
end he advocated a policy of enlightened selfishness, whereas Aquinas,
viewing the question from a Christian standpoint, saw the whole problem
as that of relating economic practice to moral standards. From his point
of view, the attainment of the Just Price was a thing that followed the
determination to be honest and straightforward in business. Apart from
exceptional cases, there was no difficulty about it. It would be arrived
at whenever men were bent upon straightforward dealing.<a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23" role="doc-noteref"><sup>23</sup></a></p>

<li id="fn23" role="doc-endnote"><p>During the War President Wilson gave
a definition of the Just Price in connection with war contracts which is
quite interesting. It runs: “By a Just Price I mean a price which will
sustain the industries concerned in a high state of efficiency, provide
a living for those who conduct them, enable them to pay good wages, and
make possible the expansion of their enterprises which will, from time
to time, become necessary, as the stupendous undertaking of this Great
War develops.”—Quoted in <em>Agricultural Prices</em>, by Henry A.
Wallace, p. 26.<a href="#fnref23" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>
</ol>
</section>
<p>I have contrasted Aquinas with Adam Smith because they represent
respectively the extreme attitudes of Mediaevalism and modernism towards
the problem of the Just Price. And yet, though Aquinas is infinitely
nearer the truth than Adam Smith, he does not express the whole truth.
For though we may agree with him in maintaining the attainment of the
Just Price to be primarily a moral question, we yet cannot agree with
him in regarding it as entirely a moral issue. For if the individual is
to maintain a perfectly moral attitude in his business relationships, it
can finally only be on the assumption that he and others who would
follow the path of rectitude are armed with power to suppress the
actions of those who have regard only to their own immediate advantage.
For just as bad money drives good out of the market, so a low standard
of commercial morality will in the long run render impossible the
maintenance of a higher one unless organisations exist to suppress the
lower one. This truth, which modern experience has brought home to
almost everyone, Aquinas did not understand; for not only is there not
to be found in his writings any suggestion of the need of organisation
to uphold the Just Price, but it is clear that he regards the issue as
one with which law is not qualified to deal; for he actually says in
this connection: “Human law cannot prohibit all that is against virtue,
it can only prohibit what would break up society. Other wrong acts it
treats as quasi-lawful, in the sense that while not approving them it
does not punish them.” However he came to make this statement I do not
understand; for not only are we to-day finding out that speculation in
prices by creating economic instability must in the long run break up
society, but all through the Middle Ages profiteering was ruthlessly
suppressed; and it is impossible to suppose that Aquinas had never heard
of the Guilds.</p>
<p>But if Aquinas did not understand that organisation was necessary to
the maintenance of the Just Price, such was not the case with the men
who organised the Guilds. They clearly understood that a high standard
of commercial morality could only be upheld on the assumption that
organisations existed to suppress a lower one, and that the Just Price
could not be maintained unless it were at the same time a fixed price.
And it is because of this that the revival of the Guilds is a question
of such fundamental importance to us. Reformers have come to see the
importance of reviving the Guilds, but they do not yet fully appreciate
the still greater importance of their corollary—the Just and Fixed
Price. And because of this, it is desirable for us to go more deeply
into this matter. It will be necessary for us to reinforce the moral
arguments in favour of the Just Price by arguments in favour of the
fixed price deduced from purely economic considerations. For if the
modern world is to be converted to a fixed price it will only be on the
assumption that we can justify it economically as well as morally.</p>
<p>On what grounds, then, is a fixed price to be justified? Because in
no other way is it possible to ensure that currency shall bear a close
and definite relationship to the real values it is supposed to
represent, or, in other words, because in no other way can currency
become a common measure of value. The principle underlying the fixed
price is a simple one—so simple, in fact, that one wonders however it
came to be overlooked. Currency, or in other words money, is a medium of
exchange. The problem is how to restrict its use to the legitimate one
of a common measure of value. So long as money is fairly and honourably
used to give value for value; so long, in fact, as money is used merely
as a token for the exchange of goods, then it will remain in a close and
definite relationship to the real values it is supposed to represent, a
practical economic equality will obtain between individuals, while
society will continue economically stable and healthy; for it will be
free from those alternating periods of boom and depression in trade that
are the inevitable corollary of speculation in prices. But unfortunately
such a desideratum does not follow naturally from the unrestricted
freedom of exchange—that is, by allowing prices to be determined by the
higgling of the market; because under such conditions there is no
equality of bargain power. The merchants and middlemen, because they
specialise in market conditions and are possessed of a reserve of
capital, find themselves in a position to exploit the community by
speculating in values, For though there are many merchants who are
scrupulously honest, market conditions are nevertheless apt to be
determined by those who use their position of vantage to the utmost and
do not disdain to indulge in smart practices. Standing between producer
and consumer, they are in a position to levy tribute from each of them.
By refusing to buy, they can compel producers to sell things to them at
less than their real value; while by refusing to sell they can compel
consumers to buy things from them at more than their real value; and by
pocketing the difference they become rich. The principle remains the
same when the middleman becomes a manufacturer, the only difference
being that the exploitation becomes then more direct. For whereas in his
capacity of merchant the middleman exploits the producer indirectly by
buying the produce of his labour at too low a price, in his capacity as
manufacturer he does it directly by paying the labourer too low a wage.
Most commercial operations partake of this nature. Their aim is to
defeat the ends of fair exchange by manipulating values. By so doing
money is <em>made</em>, as we say, and the problem of riches and poverty
created. It is a byproduct of this abuse of exchange. And for this evil
there is but one remedy—the remedy provided by the Guilds—to fix the
price of everything; for if all prices were fixed there would be no room
for the speculator. There would be nothing left to speculate in.</p>
<p>I said that if prices were fixed society would be free from the
alternating periods of boom and depression in trade that are the
inevitable corollary of speculation in prices. But we shall be told that
speculation is the soul of business, and do we propose to rob business
of its soul? In so far as that is true, we most emphatically do; for
speculation is precisely what we do want to get rid of: in the first
place because so long as speculation is considered legitimate and
practised industry must remain unstable, and the working class will be
required to bear the consequences—to suffer privations because of
chronic under-payment and periodic unemployment; in the next because so
long as speculation is the soul of business it is impossible to see how
production for service, use and beauty can ever supplant production for
profit; then so long as speculation is the soul of business the
direction of industry will remain in the hands of the financier instead
of those of the craft-master, which is contrary to the principle of
function: and finally, because unfixed prices and speculation inevitably
lead to class warfare, because they involve social and economic
injustice. In the event of a shortage, the producer exploits the
consumer; in the event of a surplus, the consumer exploits the producer.
And as production and consumption rarely balance, such a condition of
affairs gives rise to disaffection all round ; for the producer has a
grievance when there is a surplus, and the consumer has a grievance when
there is a shortage. Thus the inevitable accompaniment of speculation
and unfixed prices is unrest and dissatisfaction, the creation of a
temper of mutual distrust and suspicion, which leads finally to class
warfare.</p>
<p>Such then is the case for fixed prices. They are as necessary to-day
as they were in the Middle Ages, because the same evil demands the same
remedy. Let us try to be clear in our minds about that; for there is
nothing that stands in the way of clear thinking on social questions, or
any other question for that matter, so much as the fatal habit of
assuming that what was true in one age can have no relevance in another.
We do not apply such reasoning to the principles of Christianity. We
recognise that if Christianity was true in the Middle Ages it is true
to-day and <em>vice versa</em>. And if the truths of Christianity are
independent of time, surely their economic corollaries are in the same
way equally so independent, while it is to be affirmed that no more
difficulty stands in the way of their practical application than stands
in the way of the practical application of any other principle of
Christianity. I said no more difficulty, I should have said the same
difficulty; for in each case it is selfishness where it is not
intellectual confusion or sheer stupidity that blocks the way. The
difficulty is finally moral rather than technical, as is demonstrated by
the fact that during the War, when the desire and will were forthcoming,
the fixation of prices was found to be a perfectly practicable
proposition. That any such fixation should be unpopular in certain
quarters was inevitable, for profiteers have no desire to see their
profits curtailed. But that they were effective in that they succeeded
in preventing prices rising higher cannot be denied. A recent writer who
has some qualifications to speak with authority on the matter asserts
“that if taxation had been increased and Government control of prices
and distribution enforced earlier, the expansion of credit and currency
and the general rise of prices would have been far less.”<a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24" role="doc-noteref"><sup>24</sup></a>
And he goes on to say that “at the time of the Armistice there were many
responsible statesmen and men of affairs who advocated the retention of
much of the price-fixing machinery, at any rate for so long as economic
conditions were unsettled by the after-effects of war. These plans were
frustrated, not merely by the general dislike of State interference, but
by a still more formidable obstacle—the canons of orthodox finance.”<a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25" role="doc-noteref"><sup>25</sup></a></p>

<p>Before the War the idea of fixing prices was regarded as
impracticable and chimerical. But that is no longer the case, for the
War demonstrated that where there is a will there is a way; it
demonstrated moreover that in a time of crisis, when our national
existence was at stake, we instinctively threw overboard the canons of
orthodox finance, and it was reasonable that we should, for the canons
of orthodox finance have come into existence to subserve the interests
of private gain, and for that very reason conflict with the interests of
the community. That during the War fixed prices were accompanied by
irritating regulations is not to be denied. But that does not invalidate
the principle of fixed prices. What it does invalidate is the instrument
that was used for enforcing them. That instrument was the bureaucratic
machine—the system of control from without. It is clumsy and irritating,
but the Government had no option but to use it, for the Guild—the system
of control from within—which is the natural instrument for the
maintenance of fixed prices, was non-existent. So when we demand a
system of fixed prices, we must at the same time demand a restoration of
Guilds, for when we associate the ideas of Guilds and fixed prices many
of the problems which we find so perplexing to-day will begin to
straighten themselves out. But until we can get Guilds we must put up
with bureaucracy as the lesser of two evils. Indeed, I incline to the
opinion that the fixation of prices of the staples of industry by the
bureaucracy will pave the way for a restoration of the Guilds.</p>
<p>At the moment, then, bureaucracy is inevitable. As the problem of
price is to-day an international one and, as Mr. Lloyd has shown, is
intimately connected with the stabilisation of currencies, it follows
that any immediate effort to cope with the problem demands international
co-operation, and only a bureaucracy could undertake such a task. Yet
though fixation of prices by such means would help to stabilise the
currency, there is a limit to the number of commodities whose price
could be fixed by such means; for experience proves that a definite
limit is set to the successful operations of any bureaucracy, since in
proportion as it tends to expand its machinery gets clogged. The end of
all bureaucracies is to become strangled by red tape. If therefore we
are to fix the price of everything—and nothing less will be finally
effective, if capitalistic influences are to be entirely eliminated—it
follows that we must set to work in a systematic way and build up a
system of Guilds to enforce them. Moreover, it is important that prices
should be fixed as part of a methodical plan, beginning with the price
of food and raw materials and then gradually extending the system. That
a precedent condition of agricultural reconstruction is dependent upon
the fixation of the prices of agricultural produce has been recognised
for some time. As far back as the year 1908 Mr. Montagu Fordham, the
well-known authority on agricultural history and economics, who has had
wide practical knowledge of his subject, outlined a scheme<a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26" role="doc-noteref"><sup>26</sup></a> which was widely discussed at
numerous public meetings in the villages and in that section of the
Press which circulates in rural areas. At the time of writing the
Government Committee, to whom the question of prices in agriculture has
been referred, is taking evidence as to the possibility of fixing
agricultural prices. As to whether they will endorse such an idea it is
impossible to say. But it may be assumed that a proposal so
revolutionary will not go through without opposition, for it challenges
vested interests and prejudices at too many points to be acceptable to
“practical men” before a national propaganda has been undertaken on its
behalf.</p>

</section>
<p>Of the obstacles in the path of any systematic fixation of prices,
the Socialist prejudice is by far the most serious; for as most active
reformers at the present day are affected by Socialist economics, it is
to be feared that until this prejudice can be removed the force
necessary to effect change will not be forthcoming. Their prejudice has
its roots in the fact that as Socialist theory traces all the evils of
existing society to the institution of private property and demands its
abolition, Socialists are apt to look with suspicion upon any proposal
for dealing with the economic problem which conflicts with their
theory—the fixation of prices presenting itself as a device for
postponing the day of substantial reform. And indeed from their point of
view the suspicion is well founded, for if Just and Fixed prices were
established the case for the abolition of private property would be
gone, for most of the evils which proceed from the institution of
property would automatically disappear, while such as remained, as, for
instance, those deriving from the laws of inheritance and transfer and
its present inequality of distribution, could be removed by legislation
if the complications due to industrialism, of which we shall have
something to say later, were dealt with.</p>
<p>Looked at from this point of view, the fixation of prices presents
itself as an alternative approach to the economic problem to that
assumed by Socialists, for we see the attitude we adopt towards the
problem of price will determine our attitude towards the problem of
property and <em>vice versa</em>. If the evils which at the present time
we associate with the institution of property are to be removed, either
private ownership must be abolished or we must surround private
ownership by a series of restrictions that will prevent its abuse, and
of these the fixation of prices is by far the most important. To the
former of these alternative schemes almost all reform activity has been
devoted. But not only are we assured that the abolition of private
ownership of property is impossible in a highly industrialised society
such as ours, but where, as in Russia under the Bolshevik regime,
private ownership was abolished, experience proved that it undermined
the springs of economic activity and it was found necessary to reinstate
it, as Lenin himself had to admit.<a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27" role="doc-noteref"><sup>27</sup></a> Are we not justified
therefore in affirming that in attempting to abolish private property
Socialists are at war with the very nature of things, considering men as
they are? But if the abolition of private property undermines the
springs of economic activity, the fixation of prices would actually
stimulate it, for it is safe to say that the farmer, the craftsman, in
fact everyone who actually produces (as distinguished from those who
exploit production) would welcome fixed prices as everyone in touch with
them is well aware, for it would free them from uncertainty and anxiety
which are to-day undermining the very morale of production.<a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28" role="doc-noteref"><sup>28</sup></a></p>

</section>
<p>I confess I find it difficult to understand how in the light of the
Russian experience Socialists find it possible still to believe that the
abolition of private property is a remedy for our economic troubles. At
every step in the reconstruction of society it will be necessary to
interfere with property, yet all the same the centre of economic gravity
is to be found in price and currency rather than in property, for
currency is the vital thing, the thing of movement; it is the active
principle in economic development, while property is the passive. It is
true that profits that are made by manipulating currency sooner or later
assume the form of property, but the root mischief is not to be found in
the institution of private property but in the abuse of currency, in
speculation in prices. To solve the problem of currency by the
institution of Just and Fixed Prices under a system of Guilds is to
introduce order into the economic problem at its active vital centre.
Once having dealt with the problem of currency which lies at the centre,
it would be a comparatively easy matter to handle the problem of
property which lies at the circumference. But to begin as Socialists do
with the problem of property is to reverse the natural order of things;
for it is to proceed from the circumference to the centre, which is
contrary to the law of growth. It is to precipitate economic confusion
by dragging up society by its roots, and this defeats the ends of
revolution by strengthening the hands of the profiteer, for the
profiteer thrives on economic confusion, as is proved by the experience
of the French and Russian revolutions. Of what use is it therefore to
seek a redistribution of wealth before the profiteer has been got under
control? The effort is foredoomed to failure, since so long as men are
at liberty to manipulate exchange they will manage somehow to get the
wealth of the community into their hands. Not until Socialists come
to_see this will they be able to do anything in a practical way to
change the existing order of society. Here, incidentally, it is to be
observed that the reason why Socialists think in the terms of property
is due to the fact that for centuries reformers were accustomed to get
their political theories from lawyers, and property was the only
economic concept with which lawyers were acquainted.</p>
<p>But we are not out of the wood yet. For experience has taught us that
when we manage to persuade Socialists that the centre of economic
gravity is to be found in currency rather than property, it not
infrequently happens that they degenerate into currency cranks, when,
far from making themselves intelligible to others, they become entirely
lost to the world. The reason for this is because, as I pointed out in
the last chapter, they fall into the common error of identifying the
general problem of currency, which is extremely simple, with the highly
specialised problem of banking, it never occurring to them that the
problems of banking have their origin in the fact that usury and
speculation in prices are permitted, but would disappear with the
fixation of prices under a system of Guilds. At any rate, it is
interesting to read that Mr. Lloyd, in the book to which I have already
referred, who approaches the economic problem entirely from the point of
view of providing a sound currency system, comes to the conclusion that
the stabilisation of currency involves the fixation of prices. Thus,
after sketching a plan for international currency regulation, he says:
“It is doubtful, however, whether this object (the stabilisation of
currency) can be effectively achieved by manipulating the bank-rate and
co-operation between the Central Banks, so long as the marketing of the
staple commodities, which enter into the general index number of prices,
is carried on under competitive conditions. It might even happen that
serious disharmony in the adjustment of supply and demand in !:he case
of particular commodities might show no influence on the general level
of prices; for a sharp rise in one commodity might be offset by a
general fall in the remainder. The essence of a wider plan of
stabilisation is that the price of a fairly wide range of staple
commodities should be regulated by a similar method of international
cooperation and control. Just as under the currency reorganisation
adopted by the Genoa Conference it was proposed to stabilise the value
of gold, so under this plan stabilisation would be applied to certain
basic raw materials and foodstuffs, such as coal, petroleum, wheat,
sugar, wool, cotton, rubber, nitrates and other similar commodities in
universal and fairly constant demand. This idea should not be dismissed
offhand as impracticable. It is put forward, not indeed as an
immediately practical programme, but as an intelligent policy in keeping
with modern tendencies.”<a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29" role="doc-noteref"><sup>29</sup></a></p>

</section>
<p>Mr. Lloyd, to use his own words, is working at one end of the tunnel
and we at the other, and it looks as if we are about to meet in the
middle. Meanwhile I am persuaded it is unprofitable for any but those
with the necessary experience of finance and banking to worry about the
technical side of the problem of currency, in the stabilisation of which
bankers are as much interested as we are, and if it should finally elude
them who have the knowledge, it will certainly elude us who have not.
What we must do is to insist upon the moral aspect of the fixation of
prices, the desirability of which every man engaged in production can
understand, for it is a necessary condition of ensuring that currency
shall be used only as a common measure of value. All the problems of
currency that lead people to believe in the existence of a kind of
economic witchcraft arise from the fact that people who specialise in
finance have no intention of using money as a common measure of value.
On the contrary, they want to use money for the purpose of making more
money. And the man in the street, failing to see that all the technical
difficulties of finance arise from its anti-social intention, comes to
look upon the whole subject of finance as a mystery, and we witness the
extraordinary spectacle of people who lead Christian lives deferring in
matters of finance and industry to those whose opinions they would
indignantly repudiate if they knew the anti-social principles on which
their reasoning was based. This anomaly of the condonation of usury that
has taken place since the Reformation is partly the consequence of the
complexity of modern industry. In the Middle Ages people knew that
speculation and usury were sinful because their consequences were
obvious. But in these days usury and speculation have become so
interwoven with business that they have all the appearance of a law of
nature, and so it comes about that people hesitate to condemn practices
on a large scale that they would not hesitate to condemn on a small one.
And it is because a system of fixed prices challenges the principles of
<em>laissez-faire</em> as nothing else does that it naturally meets with
the opposition of all who still believe that <em>laissez-faire</em> is
the last word of economic wisdom.</p>
<p>That there are difficulties in the way of price-fixing is not to be
denied. It will be objected that it is impossible to base price upon the
cost of production, which a Just and Fixed Price assumes, because the
cost of production itself is variable rather than constant, varying
according to circumstances. It is not necessary to deny the truth in
this objection, but to point out that the difficulty is not an
insuperable one. There is a rough-and-ready method of determining what
constitutes a Just Price as distinguished from the
<em>laissez-faire</em> price of competitive conditions. For instance,
there is the method of price-fixing adopted during the War by the Food
Administration Department of the United States Government. It was based
upon a method of price-fixing known as the “ratio method of price
determination,” worked out by Mr. Henry A. Wallace (to whose book on
Agricultural Prices I have already referred in the footnotes), and is
advocated as a permanent remedy for price fluctuation in his organ the
<em>Wallace’s Farmer</em>. By means of carefully prepared statistical
tables, Mr. Wallace was able to show that the average market price of
agricultural produce taken over a long period of years was almost
identical with a Just Price based upon the cost of production averaged
over a corresponding number of years. And what is still more interesting
is that the fixation of such a Just Price would not only give security
to the producer, but that, by reason of the fact that producers under
such circumstances would not need such a reserve of capital and could
work on a smaller margin of profit, the prices paid by the consuming
public could be enormously reduced. “In its simplest form,” says
Mr. Wallace, “the hog producer of fifty years ago grasped the ratio
idea. Without any statistical investigation, the swine-growers of those
days came to the conclusion that they could make money when they sold
their hogs for a value per hundredweight of more than the value of ten
bushels of corn. For a generation or two hog men looked on a ratio of
ten bushels of corn to one hundred pounds of hog flesh as about right,
although they felt that such a ratio might not cover risk. How uniform
is this ratio between corn and hogs from decade to decade may be judged
from the ratios as they have prevailed year by year for the last sixty
years, and the average by decades.”<a href="#fn30" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref30" role="doc-noteref"><sup>30</sup></a> It will be seen
therefore that by a fixed price we do not mean a price that is
unalterable for all time, but a price that is periodically adjusted as
may be necessary to bring the selling price into a definite relationship
with the costs of production.</p>

<p>Anyone who has read Mr. Wallace’s book, with its hundred pages of
statistics on the subject, must, I think, be convinced that any
technical difficulties there are in the way of determining what is a
Just Price can be overcome by patient study. For of all industries
agriculture, because of its dependence on changing climatic conditions,
is the most difficult to handle from the point of view of price fixing.
And if, as Mr. Wallace has demonstrated, the difficulty is capable of
being overcome in respect to agriculture, there is no reason why it
should not be overcome in every other industry. The other difficulty
that stands in the way of the adoption of fixed prices is due to the
opposition of the business world, which is interested in the maintenance
of the <em>status quo</em>. Their objection that we have to compete in
foreign markets and therefore must be at liberty to adjust prices to
circumstances would be valid if we proposed to fix the prices of all
commodities simultaneously. We do not need to be told by business men
that such a policy would be impracticable, for it is not what we
propose. On the contrary, as we have pointed out, any fixation of prices
must be part of a methodical plan, beginning of course with agriculture
and commodities made for the home market and extending it as
circumstances and international agreements permitted. So far from such a
policy increasing our difficulties in foreign markets it would decrease
them; for the fixation of prices by eliminating middlemen’s profit and
insurance risk would, by bringing down the cost of living at home, place
us in a more favourable position to compete until fixed prices become
universal. Such being the case I do not believe the opposition of
business men will be able to frustrate permanently the movement for
fixed prices. Moreover, once social reformers come to see its centrality
and realise that the fixation of prices is a precedent condition of
stabilising wages, the battle will be won. I dislike all appeals to
social evolution, but as Socialists chose to take their stand on the
supposed truth of the principles of social evolution, when the trend of
economic development gave a certain plausibility to their measures, they
cannot object to me drawing attention to the fact that the tide has
begun to turn in our favour. All over the world, in the United States,
in Canada, Australia, New Zealand, the Argentine, Russia, and indeed
most European countries, and to a lesser extent in Great Britain, there
is a tendency for farmers to realise the principle of collective sale,
either through co-operative associations or through State intervention,
thereby acknowledging <em>ipso facto</em> the principle of fixed prices.
It is a world-wide phenomena which, taken in conjunction with the fact
that the trend of industrial development is towards the fixation of
prices by trusts, rings, and combines, leaves no room for doubt as to
what direction in the future things are going to move. What is more
interesting is that this movement back to Mediaevalism (f or rightly
interpreted it is nothing less) has come about as a result of the desire
to escape from the consequences of that economic deadlock in which Marx
foresaw the policy of maximum production was bound to culminate. In the
face of such facts it is vain to say that fixed prices are impracticable
or that they are against social evolution or any of that kind of
nonsense; for there can be no doubt that they have come to stay. The
only point is, who is going to fix them? Are they going to be fixed by
rings and combines in the private interest, or by Guilds and the State
in the public interest? Seen clearly, the issue is no longer between
fixed prices and unfixed ones, but between the Fixed and Just Price and
the fixed and unjust one. When will Socialists awaken from the trance in
which their theory of social evolution put them? Many things have
happened since Socialist theory first took shape.</p>

<section id="xiv.-the-elimination-of-usury" class="level1">
<h1>XIV. The Elimination of Usury</h1>
<p>Closely allied to the problem of the Just Price is that of usury. The
enforcement of the one and the prohibition of the other was at one time,
as we saw, insisted upon by the Mediaeval Church. But this strict view
was, in the case of usury, modified by later moralists and economists,
who came to believe that to forbid the taking of interest under all
circumstances was not expedient, inasmuch as it led to serious public
inconvenience. Hence the question which agitated the minds of moralists
and economists in the thirteenth, fourteenth, and fifteenth centuries
was how to determine what was and what was not legitimate. Starting from
the principle of Aristotle that money itself cannot beget money, they
were puzzled as to how to justify the taking of interest. They were
agreed that to seek to increase wealth in order to live on the labour of
others was wrong; and to this extent the issue was a purely moral one.
But, on the other hand, there was the question of public convenience, as
in the case of travellers who would have to carry large sums of money
about with them in the absence of bills of exchange, or the question of
risk involved in a loan. To all such difficult and perplexing problems
the Mediaeval moralists addressed themselves, not for theoretical, but
for practical reasons. For as commerce tended to increase it became
urgent to hammer out some principle whereby the necessities of trade
could be related to some definite moral standard.</p>
<p>To the end the problem evaded them. In principle all were against
usury, but public convenience demanded that exception be made under
certain circumstances. These exceptions grew and grew in number, but no
sure principle was forthcoming. And so things went on until the
Reformation, when, in the latter half of the sixteenth century, a breach
was effected with Mediaeval doctrine and practice. Not that the leaders
of the Reformation were advocates of usury. On the contrary, they were
even more opposed to any compromise with usury than Catholic
theologians. But the effect of the Reformation had been to destroy the
unity of the Church. And this, by undermining authority on the one hand
and by causing Lutheran divines to lean upon territorial princes and the
merchant class, opened the way for a change of attitude towards usury by
accommodating morals to the practice of the rich. Calvin’s attitude
proved to be the turning point. He objected to the idea of regarding
money as barren. He was prepared to justify the taking of interest with
certain qualifications, such as “that usury should not be demanded from
men in need; nor is it lawful to force any man to pay usury who is
oppressed by need or calamity”; and “he who receives a loan on usury
should make at least as much for himself by his labour and care as he
who obtains which gives the loan.”<a href="#fn31" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref31" role="doc-noteref"><sup>31</sup></a> But “in after
centuries Calvin’s great authority was invoked for the wide proposition
that to take reward for the loan of money was never sinful; and a couple
of his sentences were taken from their context and quoted without regard
to the conditions by which they were limited. His careful qualified
approval of the claim for usury when it was made by one business man to
another was wrested into an approval of every sort of contract
concerning the loan of money.”<a href="#fn32" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref32" role="doc-noteref"><sup>32</sup></a></p>

</section>
<p>Henceforth business and usury became so closely identified that it
became impossible to separate them. They have between them been the
force behind the modern industrial development. Usury has become so much
a part of our industrial activities that it is difficult for the
individual to feel any sense of personal responsibility in the matter.
We are all so much involved that acquiescence in it has come to partake
more of the nature of a corporate than an individual sin. If a man in
the Middle Ages was a usurer he knew it, and his neighbours knew it, and
he was treated with the cold suspicion which was his fitting reward. But
no one who receives a dividend from a limited liability company, or
receives interest on War Loan stock, considers himself in any sense of
the word a usurer, which term of opprobrium he reserves for the
professional moneylender. And indeed in the moral sense there is a
difference between the dividend receiver and the moneylender. It is the
difference between the absentee landlord, who may in his personal
relations be an excellent man, and his steward, who, perhaps unknown to
him, screws money out of his tenants. For the great evil connected with
limited liability companies is that they have fastened the evil of
absenteeism upon industry, and as such have been the root of endless
mischief; for under them responsibility is divided among so many people
that nobody feels himself personally to blame for their shortcomings.
Yet though there may be a moral difference between the dividend receiver
and the moneylender, the economic consequences, so far as the general
well-being is concerned, is the same. For the law of compound interest
is to accumulate, whether the increment be the work of moneylenders or
dividend receivers. And it stands to reason that this process of
accumulation cannot go on indefinitely, as the famous arithmetical
calculation that a halfpenny put out to five per cent, compound interest
on the first day of the Christian era would by now amount to more money
than the earth contains clearly demonstrates. Yet what to-day is called
“sound finance” proceeds upon the assumption that there is no limit to
compound interest. The consequence is that industry has become burdened
with a load it can no longer bear. Meanwhile the usurers, in their
anxiety to increase dividends, have so impoverished the people that they
cannot afford to buy the goods which industry produces, and the only
remedy they can think of is to produce goods cheaper by lowering wages,
entirely losing sight of the fact that to lower wages is to reduce
purchasing power still further. The crisis that nowadays has overtaken
industry was making its appearance before the War. But the
£7,000,000,000 War Debt, bearing interest at the rate of £350,000,000 a
year, has “put the lid on,” as we say. It has precipitated an economic
deadlock, resulting in widespread unemployment, that must remain
insoluble until the problem of usury among others is faced.</p>
<p>This is the dilemma of civilisation. What is to be done about it?
There are times when one feels as if nothing would get done, and that
the usurers will go on demanding their pound of flesh regardless of
consequences to themselves as much as to others until finally the end
comes, suggesting that a civilisation that takes to usury perishes by
usury. There is the Douglas Credit scheme, which proposes to resolve the
deadlock by the redistribution of purchasing power in the form of
dividends for all. It sounds plausible, yet not only does one feel that
it is utterly impracticable, but that it is a skilful evasion of the
whole difficulty; for the evil is surely primarily moral rather than
technical, and it has personal roots. If men sin, we may be assured that
there is no remedy apart from repentance, and that the consequences of
sin are not to be cancelled by a chartered accountant. Hence, we may be
assured, a solution of the problem of usury will not follow a new system
of book-keeping, which is what the Douglas Credit scheme amounts to, but
a change in the heart and mind of men. And it is for this reason that we
entirely repudiate the idea which advocates of the scheme affirm, that
the “problem of finance is as technical as a main drainage scheme.”</p>
<p>When people do come to see that the economic problem has personal
roots, it not infrequently happens that when they take the thing
seriously they go off at a tangent, hoping to do something towards the
solution of the problem by refusing to take any interest on money
themselves. Apart from exceptional cases, where the refusal to take
interest means that individual cases of hardship are relieved, action of
this kind avails nothing; for its only effect is to swell still more the
pockets of those who have no misgivings about usury; while, moreover, it
is impossible to expect many people to act in this way; for, in the case
of an enormous mass of people, it would mean a complete loss of income;
in others it would mean constant anxiety; while in others, again, the
decision to forgo all interest on money would mean that work, which at
the present juncture is of fundamental importance to society, would
never get done, because it has nO immediate economic value, for such
work can only be done to-day by people possessed of private means. For a
variety of reasons, therefore, there is no reason to suppose that any
considerable number of people will act in such an heroic way. And there
is no reason why they should; for the way to replace the present system
of industry based upon usury by one that is not, is not to advise people
to forgo their dividends, but to advise them to spend their spare money
in a way beneficial to the community, instead of reinvesting it for the
purposes of further increase. If the rich could be persuaded to use
their money in this way the pressure of competition would be so much
relieved that it would be possible in the course of a generation for
people to refuse altogether to have anything to do with usury without
having to face the fear of poverty, which most people would have to face
to-day if they refused to take any more dividends. And if we cannot
persuade the rich to do this, there is no reason to suppose they could
be persuaded to forgo interest entirely.</p>
<p>The custom of investing spare money for further increase is so
general to-day that we are apt to forget that the custom is a
comparatively recent one. In former times it was the custom for the
wealthy to spend their yearly surplus upon such things as architecture,
the patronage of the arts and letters, the endowment of religion,
educational and charitable institutions, and in suchlike ways. Such
expenditure was good, because it kept money in circulation. It
stimulated demand and created employment by maintaining a balance
between demand and supply. Until a couple of generations ago this
tradition of using money survived in the old Tory school, whose faith it
was that the spending of money gave employment, while bridging the gulf
between rich and poor. What destroyed this excellent tradition was the
introduction of machinery and the coming of the limited liability
company, which opened up so many more channels of profitable investment
that the aristocratic tradition of spending was not only lost sight of,
obscured, and forgotten, but people actually came to believe that they
were doing a positive service to the community when they invested any
spare money they might possess in some new industrial enterprise instead
of spending it. Yet such is not the case; for the present deadlock that
has overtaken industry is in no small measure due to this misdirection
of surplus wealth. For whereas money that is spent does return into
general circulation, the effect of investing and reinvesting surplus
money is in the long run to withdraw it from circulation, much in the
same way as if it were hoarded. Nay, it is actually worse than if it
were hoarded. Hoarded money may undermine demand, but it does not
increase supply, whereas when reinvestment proceeds beyond a certain
point it increases supply and undermines demand at the same time. This
upsets the balance between demand and supply, which in turn is
productive of waste. For when more money is invested in any industry
than is required for its proper conduct the pressure of com- petition is
increased, and this increases the selling costs by encouraging the
growth of the number of middlemen, who levy toll upon industry, while it
increases the expenditure on advertisements and other overhead charges,
bringing about over-capitalisation. That, in turn, gives rise to every
kind of dirty trick and smart practice, which are resorted to in the
attempt to produce dividends on the watered capital.</p>
<p>Viewing the problem in this light, it is evident that the first step
to be taken to mitigate the evil of usury and to resolve the economic
deadlock that has overtaken industry is to advise people to spend money
in the way it was customary to spend it in the past rather than to be
for ever reinvesting it for the purpose of further increase; for
spending money increases demand. But it will make a great deal of
difference the way it is spent. Merely to increase personal expenditure
is not desirable, for it brings other evils in its train. Wise
expenditure would result in it being spent in impersonal waj^s, and at
the present time there could be no wiser way than to spend it in
building houses, to relieve the housing problem; while if such
expenditure was generous and wise, ignoring entirely returns in rent, it
would, do a great deal towards the revival of architecture, for
architecture will never revive so long as people build for investment.
In former times people did not expect building to pay. They looked upon
it as a way of using spare money. When they come to look upon building
again in this light conditions will be created favourable to the rebirth
of architecture.</p>
<p>In other directions the problem of usury can only be solved by means
of organisation. It seems to me that the reason why the Mediaeval
moralists and economists could find no answer to the problems which
usury presented was due to the fact that that problem is only partly a
moral one. And in the same way that they failed to realise that the only
way finally to give effect to the principle of the Just Price is to make
it at the same time a Fixed Price to be maintained by Guilds, so they
failed to realise that the difficulties in which they found themselves
in their attempts to justify the taking of interest in certain cases in
order that the public convenience might not suffer arose from the fact
that the function that the usurer performed in such cases was
essentially a public one, and should have been undertaken by men in some
corporate capacity, and not left to the initiative of individuals. It
could have been overcome by organisation; for it is safe to say that if,
in the Middle Ages, the Guilds, instead of being confined to the towns,
had been co-extensive with society, the problems of usury and currency
would never have arisen. For while on the one hand, by the maintenance
of Just and Fixed Prices, such Guilds would have operated to keep money
in a close and definite relationship to the real values it is supposed
to represent, on the other, by making provision for their members in
times of sickness or adversity, little room would have remained for the
snares of the usurer, and what little there was could doubtless have
been overcome by organisation of one kind or another. Unfortunately,
however, this most obvious solution of the problem of usury never
appears to have occurred to the Mediaeval moralists and economists, who,
envisaging the problem entirely as a moral one, were as blind to the
need of organisation to enforce moral standards upon the recalcitrant
minority as reformers to-day, envisaging the social problem as entirely
one of organisation, are as a rule equally blind to the need of a moral
basis to give vitality to their organisations. In the sixteenth century,
however, the Franciscans do appear to have come to some such conclusion;
for they founded the <em>monies pietatis</em>, or lending houses, which
advanced loans to poor people either without interest or at a very low
rate, and thus prevented many from falling into the hands of usurers.
The change of attitude, however, came too late to stop the onrushing
torrent.</p>

<section id="xv.-regulative-and-producing-guilds" class="level1">
<h1>XV. Regulative and Producing Guilds</h1>
<p>If the centre of gravity of the economic problem is to be found in
currency and price rather than in property, every other problem in
society will assume a different perspective—questions which nowadays are
regarded as issues of primary and fundamental importance will be
relegated to a secondary position, while issues that hitherto have been
treated as secondary and unimportant will become matters of primary
interest.</p>
<p>In this process of transformation our conception of the nature and
purpose of the Guild will be completely changed, inasmuch as regulation
rather than production will now become its primary aim. Producing Guilds
have hitherto found favour among Socialists because they recommended
themselves as instruments for the abolition of the private ownership of
property, the substitution of workers’ control for private management
being considered a means towards this end. But once it is recognised
that the centre of economic gravity is to be found in currency and price
rather than in property, a different type of Guild will find favour,
since from this point of view the primary aim of Guild activity is the
regulation of prices, and the type of Guild best adapted to perform this
function is not the Producing but the Mediaeval or Regulative type,
which would superimpose over each industry an organisation to regulate
its affairs much in the same way that professional societies enforce a
discipline among their members, with the difference that, in addition to
upholding a standard of professional conduct, such Guilds would be
concerned to promote a certain measure of economic equality among their
members, in the same way that trade unions do to-day. Such guilds would
insist that all who were engaged in any industry should conform to its
regulations, which would be concerned with such things as the
maintenance of Just and Fixed Prices and rates of wages, the regulation
of machinery and apprenticeship, the upholding of a standard of quality
in production, the prevention of adulteration and bad workmanship,
mutual aid, and other matters appertaining to the conduct of industry
and the personal welfare of its members.</p>
<p>Though such Regulative Guilds are identical in principle with the
Mediaeval Guilds, there is yet no technical difficulty that stands in
the way of their establishment over industry to-day; for the principles
to which it is proposed they should give practical application are
finally nothing more than the enforcement of moral standards. For though
modern industry differs from Mediaeval industry, the differences are
technical, and no technical difference can involve a difference of moral
principles. On the contrary, what is involved is a difference in
application, inasmuch as whereas the Mediaeval Guilds only exercised
control over employers and their assistants engaged in small workshops
and owned by small masters, our proposed modern Regulative Guilds would
exercise control over employers and workers engaged in both large and
small factories and workshops owned by private individuals, joint-stock
companies and self-governing groups of workers. To make such control
effective, it would be necessary to depart from the rules of the
Mediaeval Guilds to the extent that authority would have to be vested in
the whole body of members—employers and workers—instead of being
exclusively in the hands of the masters, as was the case in the Middle
Ages. For the typical employer to-day is not a master of his craft, who
is jealous for its honour, as was the Mediaeval employer, but a
financier who is only interested in the profit and loss account, and
therefore is not to be trusted with final authority. Hence the
conclusion that if any standards of honesty and fair dealing are to be
upheld, prices and wages fixed on a basis of justice, machinery and
other things necessary to the proper conduct of industry to be
regulated, the final authority must be vested in the trade as a whole,
for only those who suffer from the growth of abuses can be relied upon
to take measures to suppress them.<a href="#fn33" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref33" role="doc-noteref"><sup>33</sup></a></p>

<li id="fn33" role="doc-endnote"><p>Such a conception of industrial
reorganisation is not as remote from practical politics as many will
assume, for the scheme of industrial reorganisation proposed in the

</section>
<p>In comparison with the enforcement of such moral standards over
industry, all other issues, such as whether the workers be engaged in
co-operative production or Producing Guilds, whether they have small
workshops of their own or are employed by others, are secondary. They
are not matters of principle, but of expediency or personal preference.
There is no greater mistake than to suppose that every man would prefer
to work cooperatively with others. On the contrary, the majority—the
vast majority, I believe—would, other things being equal, prefer to be
employers or employed. Any number of men prefer to work as assistants
because they don’t like responsibility, while there are numbers of men
of a masterful disposition who are too individualistic by temperament to
love co-operation and who would be mere grit and friction inside any
organisation on a co-operative basis, while again it is to be observed
that there are many men who prefer to work under such men of a masterful
disposition because they like to know just where they are, and others
prefer to work alone. Preferences of this kind have nothing to do with
indifference to or love of money. Men may be any of these things and be
good or bad citizens; it is entirely a question of differences of
temperament. For this reason a mixed economy which is flexible and
contains different types of organisation is best adapted to differing
human needs and the varied circumstances of industry. What is important
is that these various types of men in any single industry—employers,
employed, co-operators—should submit to the same statutes and
regulations or suffer expulsion. If moral standards are enforced over
industry by Regulative Guilds the particular way men preferred to work
or organise could be left for themselves to decide, for their
differences could have no harmful consequences; while it is to be
observed the enforcement of the Guild discipline would tend to weed out
undesirable forms of industrial organisation such as limited liability
companies.</p>
<p>Such then is our conception of the primary purpose of Guild
organisation. But it is not on this basis that the Guild idea has
hitherto been promoted in this country. On the contrary, approaching the
problem of Guild organisation from the point of view of property rather
than currency and price regulation, the Guild idea became identified
with that of co-operative production or Producing Guilds; for National
Guilds was an attempt to give universal application to a principle of
organisation that on a small scale was practised with success under the
auspices of the co-operative movement by giving it a base in the Trade
Unions, and it would have cleared the air of a great deal of discussion
at cross purposes if from the first they had been called Producing
Guilds instead of National Guilds ; for it is not the Guild idea in the
larger sense as expressed in the Regulative Guild or even the Producing
Guilds that is finally called in question by the failure of the Building
Guilds, but the particular policy and form of organisation popularised
by the National Guilds League, as nowadays its members are prepared to
admit. National Guilds, as we have always insisted, was a compromise,
and a compromise that could not last, for it was compounded of
incompatibilities. So far, therefore, from the failure of the Building
Guilds heralding the defeat of the Guild idea, it should, by exposing
the inconsistency of the National Guild position, prepare the way for
its acceptance. For it has not been the Mediaeval elements in Guild
theory that have been found wanting in practice, but the modernist ones
that it borrowed from Collectivism.</p>
<p>Meanwhile it will be interesting to compare the Building Guild
experiment with the Italian Producing Guilds<a href="#fn34" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref34" role="doc-noteref"><sup>34</sup></a>
for the failure of the one and the success of the other may suggest to
us the lines upon which a new policy for Producing Guilds should be
based. In this connection the first great difference that we notice is
that, compared with the Italian Guilds, our Building Guilds were exotic.
They were created artificially from above to execute the housing schemes
and developed with such rapidity as to engender all the defects and
shortcomings which everywhere accompany organisations of mushroom
growth. For their difficulty of obtaining credit, which was the
immediate cause of failure, and the internal problems of organisation
which, apart from the problem of credit, must eventually have resulted
in failure, were both largely the result of a too rapid growth; for when
growth is too rapid, organisations do not grow up in an organic way, and
suffer in consequence from a multitude of maladjustments which, leading
to confusion and dissensions, are apt to prove disruptive.</p>

<p>In Italy the development was different. The Producing Guilds there
originated, as did the smaller Producing Guilds in this country which
came into existence as a result of the boom of the Building Guilds, to
provide work for the unemployed, and their development in the early
stages was very slow indeed, for it should be known the Italian Building
Guilds are already sixty years old. Thus it was, instead of being
promoted from above, they began at the very bottom of things—often as
mere organisations of labour undertaking simple works such as nav vying,
where “labour” is the most expensive “raw material.” From such humble
beginnings they gradually advanced step by step, consolidating their
position as they went on, until they could undertake works of importance
where more plant and capital was required. And because they grew up
slowly in this unobtrusive way they were never seriously perplexed by
the problem of credit on the one hand nor with difficulties of internal
organisation on the other, while the fact that at the beginning they had
no idea of creating a new social order, no other aim in fact than to
provide work for the unemployed, any working theory that they have come
to possess has been the result of experience and not the result of any
<em>a priori</em> reasonings, for any other “ism”—Socialism,
Syndicalism, or Fascism—with which any of the Guilds may be identified
to-day has been grafted on to them since and had nothing to do with
their origin.</p>
<p>To understand this is important. For the immunity of the Italian
Guilds in their early stages of development from the disruptive
influence of Socialist theories led them to adopt a common-sense
attitude towards the problems confronting them which might otherwise
have been impossible. The Italian Guildsmen began by accepting the fact
that the Guilds they organised had to function within the capitalist
system and be as businesslike as any private firm, and did not therefore
attempt to push the principles of democratic control so far as to make
such functioning impossible. For when such principles are pushed too
far, as it is in National Guild theory, the rank and file inevitably
come into collision with the administrative staff, into whose hands
decision as to details inevitably falls, for there is a limit to the
number of things to which committees can attend. The non-recognition of
this fact was a constant source of friction in the Building Guilds.
Their ideal was to be democratic from the top to the bottom, and this
led to an extraordinary multiplicity of committees, which made the
organisation of the whole of industry upon such a basis a proposition
entirely unthinkable.<a href="#fn35" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref35" role="doc-noteref"><sup>35</sup></a> Experience was to prove that on the
ultra-democratic basis upon which they were organised there was no
discoverable basis of co-operation between the administrative staff and
the rank and file; a fact which came very much in evidence every time a
new appointment was to be made. And this difficulty inherent in National
Guild theory was further complicated by the fact that the rapid growth
of the Building Guilds necessitated the recruitment of their
administrative staffs from the middle class instead of from the rank and
file as was possible in Italy because of their slower growth, and this,
because it involved differences in economic status, naturally led to
dissatisfaction in an organisation that came into existence to promote
economic equality.</p>

<p>The different standards of living of the working and middle classes
is a real obstacle in the path of their close co-operation in any
organisation that is democratically controlled. For though the
middle-class Socialist when he preaches economic equality means that
with a better distribution of wealth the working class would be raised
up to his own standard of living, the idea is interpreted by the
working-class man as meaning that the middle-class man should be
prepared to accept the same wage or salary as himself. And this
constitutes a real difficulty that should be faced. It is to be traced
to the fatal habit of reformers of exalting a standard of idealism which
they personally are not prepared to act upon. It borders on insincerity,
for I do not think the middle-class Socialist has any right to ask the
working class to live up to a standard of social idealism that he is not
prepared to live up to himself. Yet it seems to me that this is what
happened under the Building Guilds; for while the working-class member
was asked to work at a standard rate and forgo any share in any profits
that he might help to produce, the middle-class man expected to take his
share out in the form of a higher salary. Much of the demoralisation
that overtook the Building Guild was, I am persuaded, traceable to this
fact, for it was much talked about. It seems to me if wages and salaries
are not to be equal, it would be wiser to allow the workers to have a
share in the profits, as is the case with Producers, Co-operatives. I
say it is the wiser thing—I should say, I think it is the only thing—to
do, if disaster is not going to follow disaster. And I can see no
objection to it. For if we had Regulative Guilds that would maintain
just and fixed prices and wages and other matters relating to the
conduct of industry, such Producing Guilds could not degenerate into
capitalist concerns, for all the distribution of such profits would mean
would be that men were rewarded for any extra exertion they might put
into their work, and this would provide the incentive that is required
to keep up the morale of the Guild. This, I submit, is only common
sense. The men in the Building Guild worked hard at the beginning. But
after a twelvemonth, when the wave of enthusiasm had spent itself, there
came the inevitable reaction which always follows the attempt to live up
to an idealism pitched in too high a key. Of course Socialists are led
into this error by their belief in the natural perfection of mankind,
whereas the fact is most demonstrable that all men are sinners.</p>
<p>I do not know if a time will ever come when the whole of industry
will be organised in local Producing Guilds under the control of
National Regulative Guilds, but if it did it might prove to be a
misfortune, the prelude of decline, for if private management were
entirely to disappear I cannot help feeling that initiative would
disappear with it. It would disappear under Producing Guilds as it is
disappearing under limited liability companies, and for precisely the
same reason—that as the majority of men lack imagination, they are only
willing to adopt any new idea when it has been proved to them by
demonstration, and as it is for this reason invariably impossible to get
any committee to back any new idea from the start, it follows that new
developments are only possible on the assumption that private industry
is not entirely extinguished. The entire disappearance of private
industry would certainly place an insuperable obstacle in the path of
the revival of the crafts and arts. “Economic co-operation,” says
Dr. Jacks, “runs to quantity, because quantity is something that can be
proved to everybody’s satisfaction; meanwhile quality, which is
incapable of proof, is apt to suffer.”<a href="#fn36" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref36" role="doc-noteref"><sup>36</sup></a> I
am not quite sure whether this will always be true, but it is certainly
true to-day –at any rate so far as the crafts and arts are concerned
–for it seems to be absolutely impossible to forge any permanent link
between them and any form of collective activity at the present time, in
spite of ^the constant efforts that are made to overcome the difficulty.
It may be argued that if Regulative Guilds were established and prices
fixed, the difficulty would disappear. But I am not quite sure whether
such would be the case, for the difficulty is psychological as well as
economic, and it is possible that if the economic difficulty were
removed the psychological difficulty would remain, because in the
absence of private industry the more enlightened minority would be
powerless against the blind majority into whose hands the control of
administrative machinery would fall. Viewed in this light, the problem
of the arts presents itself finally not as a problem of taste but of
power. It is the problem of keeping open an avenue for their revival,
and my fear is that if Producing Guilds become too widely established
before the arts are revived all such avenues would be finally closed.
For if bad traditions of design and workmanship once get into such
guilds, as seems inevitable to-day, there will be no getting them out
again apart from outside influence. This is one of the many reasons why
I feel that Regulative Guilds should come first.</p>

<section id="xvi.-property-and-function" class="level1">
<h1>XVI. Property and Function</h1>
<p>A consideration of the problems of management and control naturally
leads to a consideration of those of property, for the two are so
inseparably bound up together that any attitude we adopt towards the one
inevitably affects our attitude towards the other. Socialists have been
perfectly consistent in maintaining that the abolition of the private
ownership of property involves the abolition of private management of
industry. In the same way an acceptance of the private management of
industry involves an acceptance of the institution of private
property.</p>
<p>The reason for this is not far to seek. The private management of
industry involves the recognition of the principle of private property,
because in the long run it is impossible rightly to perform any function
apart from the personal independence that the possession of property
gives. The truth of this is illustrated by the changes that have taken
place in the spirit and conduct of industry since the spread of limited
liability companies. Prior to their getting possession of industry, the
financier without technical experience had little or no footing in
production. On the contrary, the control and ownership of industry was
in the hands of men who invariably understood the practical and
technical side of industry in addition to its business side; for most
capitalists were men who had risen from the ranks. But with the spread
of limited liability companies, the ownership of industry was taken out
of the hands of the men who had technical knowledge of it and placed in
the hands of shareholders who had no such knowledge. Thus the spirit and
conduct of industry was completely changed. It is true that before the
days of limited companies there was plenty of profiteering in industry.
But side by side with profiteering there existed a certain pride in the
work produced, a certain craft spirit prevailed, for everything was not
sacrificed to profits. If men loved profits, most of them also valued
their reputation for producing a good article and for fair dealing. And,
where they did not suffer from foreign competition, whether or not a man
lived up to a standard was largely optional with him. But limited
companies have changed all this. The shareholders in whose hands control
is finally vested do not share the craft traditions of the manufacturer
who rose from the ranks. They are only interested in extracting out of
an industry as much profit as possible for themselves. This has been
followed by a transfer of the control of industry from the hands of men
with technical experience into the hands of financiers, touts, and
salesmen, who have subordinated technical men to themselves. The change
has exercised a most demoralising influence upon industry, for
experience proves that such men cannot manage industry. On the contrary,
all they can do is to exploit it, which is a very different thing. For
good management means, among other things, the prevention of waste. But
since financiers and salesmen have come into control, waste has been
constantly increasing. In the long run this must bring disaster to
limited liability companies. though in the meantime they manage to put
off the evil day by rings and combines of all kinds, which keep up the
prices.</p>
<p>The reason for this constant increase of waste is to be found partly
in the fact that limited companies, by their control of capital, have
brought into existence organisations so large as to become almost
unmanageable, and partly because the managers, who, as a rule, are
financial men without any technical training, do not know how to make
appointments on the technical side. Being without the inside knowledge
that comes with technical experience, the managers can only judge men by
appearances. In consequence, promotion in large commercial organisations
no longer goes with doing good and valuable work, for that is hidden
from the eyes of the managers; but with toadying to men in position;
with maintaining a certain bluff, an appearance of doing things, but not
with actually doing them, which is much more likely to lead to trouble
by incurring the jealousy of “duds” in high places; with managing things
in such a way so as to secure the credit for oneself for things that are
successful and to shuffle off responsibility for failure on to the
shoulders of others. This is not difficult in large organisations, for
it is generally impossible except for those actually on the job to know
exactly for what work any particular individual is responsible. There
are, of course, exceptions to this rule, but then there are exceptional
circumstances, and an institution is to be judged by its norm and not by
its exceptions. No one who has ever worked inside a large commercial
organisation will deny that success goes to the bounder, to the man who
studies the game rather than the work. And it is because of this that
limited companies have demoralised industry; for when men began to find
that competence was not rewarded and honour not appreciated, all the old
incentives that gave a morale to industry were gone. There was no one
left to set a standard.</p>
<p>For these evils nationalisation is no remedy; for though the element
of profit-making would be removed if the Government took over industry
and property, yet the divorce of function from ownership, which is the
central evil of limited companies, would remain, while certain other
evils which are peculiar to State activities would be added. Such being
the case, it is apparent that the remedy demands among other things the
restriction, if not the abolition, of limited companies, and such a
redistribution of property as would unite again function and ownership.
And here it is necessary to observe that the remedy proposed by the
Douglas Credit scheme, which professes to be a form of Distributivism,
would be no remedy at all, even if it were practicable, which I am
assured it is not, since a scheme that provides “dividends for all”
would perpetuate the divorce between function and ownership. And so long
as that remains there can be no restoration of the morale of
industry.</p>
<p>But to reunite function and ownership involves the acceptance of the
principle of private property. And as we found in the case of private
management that the wise course was to accept the institution whilst
protecting society against its abuse by superimposing over industry a
system of Guilds, so I am persuaded that the right treatment of the
problem of property is not to be found in the abolition of private
ownership, but in taking measures to safeguard society against its
abuse. In this connection I feel that a limit should be placed to the
rights of property in two directions. There should, in the first place,
be no private property in land in the sense that land should not be
treated as a commodity to be bought and sold. On the contrary, it should
be owned by the community as a whole, or by the parish, who would lease
it out to individuals or groups of workers on a moderate rental. An
arrangement incidentally, it is to be observed, which was advocated in
the eighteenth century and from which the idea of the single tax
derives. For, according to Thomas Spence, who originally made this
proposal, the revenues from the rents would form the only tax from which
the expenses of local and central government would be defrayed.<a href="#fn37" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref37" role="doc-noteref"><sup>37</sup></a> This restriction of private
property is necessary because there is no doubt that the growth of
economic tyrannies follows trafficking in land. And as under a system of
Guilds the producer would be compelled to sell his produce at a Just and
Fixed Price and to pay just wages, it appears to me that under such
conditions the Socialist case against private property entirely
disappears. For under such conditions the Socialist ideal would be
fulfilled, inasmuch as, while the individual would be secure in the
fruits of his labour, he would not be in a position to abuse his
position by trespassing on the rights of others. It would, moreover, be
a return to the Mediaeval principle of reciprocal rights and duties; for
as no one under such conditions could hold property for any other
purpose than for the performance of function, all idea of absolute
property rights would disappear.<a href="#fn38" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref38" role="doc-noteref"><sup>38</sup></a></p>

<p>The application of these principles would solve the problem of
property in rural areas and in so far as small industries are concerned.
It would also mitigate the evils of private ownership where large-scale
production obtains to the extent of guarding the community against the
abuses of property. But it would not solve the problem of how the
individual worker in a large industry is to secure his share of the
wealth he helps to create. Before the introduction of machinery the
problem of property was theoretically a simple one. The instruments of
production were such as to interpose no obstacle to the organisation of
society on a basis of equity; for when the only instruments of
production were the tools of the handicraftsman, there was no technical
difficulty to stand in the way of a reasonable distribution of property.
On the contrary, the problem that did exist was entirely a moral one. It
was the problem of inducing men to obey the moral law in the sphere of
economics, of preventing men from obtaining more than their share of
property. But once machinery was invented and large-scale production
came into existence, the terms of the problem were changed, and the
moral problem became complicated by a technical problem of ownership
that has so far proved to be entirely insoluble from the point of view
of the general well-being of society. It was the apparent impossibility
of finding a satisfactory solution for this problem that led Socialists
in the past to attempt to escape from the dilemma in which the
unrestricted use of machinery involves the problem of property and
ownership by demanding the abolition of all private property whatsoever.
At the time this solution was first promulgated, it recommended itself
as the line of least resistance. But experience is proving that to
attempt the abolition of private property is to follow the line of
maximum resistance; for there is no reason to suppose that the problem
of industrial property will ever be solved by direct action. And as
experience proves that Producing Guilds can only be successful under
industrialism within very narrow limits, the problem would be entirely
insoluble but for one consideration—that the unrestricted use of
machinery that stands in the way of any solution of the problem of
property stands also in the way of the solution of every other problem
of society—of religion, law, politics, arts, crafts, organisation,
currency, the family, and other social traditions. This consideration
leads us to the conclusion that a precedent condition of finding a
solution to the problem of property or any other social problem is to
make up our minds about the place of machinery in society, for the
attitude which we adopt towards it finally determines our attitude
towards every other problem of society.</p>
</section>
<section id="xvii.-the-break-up-of-industrialism" class="level1">
<h1>XVII. The Break-Up of Industrialism</h1>
<p>In the preceding chapters we defined the principles upon which a
reconstituted society should rest. While we saw that some of them were
capable of immediate application, we found the problem of property an
obstacle in our path, inasmuch as any solution that would relate
property to personal needs cannot be harmonised with the circumstances
of industrial production and <em>vice versa</em>. In these circumstances
we are led to inquire whether industrialism, as we understand it, is a
natural and normal development of industry with a future before it, or
whether it is not a thing altogether abnormal, a blind alley from which
we must retrace our steps or perish.</p>
<p>To this question I can find but one answer. Industrialism is a thing
altogether abnormal, and for that reason has no future. Evidence in
support of this contention is to be found in the political and economic
confusion that has overtaken the world. Modern civilisation is the
creation of our industrial methods of production in the sense that apart
from their invention it could never have come into existence nor be
maintained. Before the War, the comfortable theory obtained that the
confusion, which it was admitted had followed the introduction of steam
power and machinery, was the inevitable accompaniment of an age of
transition. It was analogous to the confusion of youth and would
disappear before the growth of maturity. Meanwhile the increase of
productive capacity was laying a foundation of material well-being in
which every member of society would eventually share. The War knocked
the bottom out of that breezy optimism by revealing industrialism in a
different light. Confronted by the world catastrophe, the theory that
industrialism and militarism were opposed in principle and that
militarism, which was the mark of a lower stage of social evolution,
would disappear before the growth of industrialism, which was the mark
of a higher stage of social evolution, was rendered altogether
untenable, since industrialism and militarism as they exist in Europe
to-day are too obviously parts of the same disease, inasmuch as both are
expressions of the bent given to the human mind by the worship of wealth
and the cult of mechanism; while so far from industrialism making for
peace and militarism for war, they give each other mutual support. For
while, on the one hand, the need of industrial nations for ever-widening
markets and new sources of raw material is a constant source of
international friction and creates an atmosphere favourable to war, on
the other it is demonstrable that war on such a prodigious scale as the
late one would have been impossible apart from the whole industrial
apparatus of mechanical transport, telegraphs, tinned foods, and the
thousand and one other devices indispensable to modern warfare.</p>
<p>For a century industrialism and militarism pressed forward together
towards a common disaster. Yet mechanism of itself cannot produce war.
To do that it must be allied with passion. If men were to be induced to
fight, if they were to be preached into the trenches, war had to be
idealised. And so it came about that the sordid realities behind the War
were carefully concealed from the popular eye, while it was loudly
proclaimed that the War was a war to end wars, it was to make the world
safe for democracy. But figs do not grow on thistles in spite of
journalistic enterprise. Once the War was well on the way, rampant
profiteering broke loose, and the suspicion gained ground that the War
was not being fought to make the world safe for democracy, but to make
it safe for plutocracy. At any rate, by the time the War came to an end,
idealism was as good as dead. The Treaty of Versailles, instead of
exhibiting that spirit of magnanimity which might have paved the way to
universal peace, provided only another illustration of the dictum of
Herodotus that “revenge is the one law of history,” since so far from
measures being taken to prevent another catastrophe, it sowed the seeds
of further trouble. The League of Nations was instituted to keep up
appearances, but the passions that the War had let loose craved
satisfaction, and they found it in a peace that has proved to be no less
disastrous than the War, to victors as to vanquished.</p>
<p>It is easy to see how all this came about. There were tv/o, and only
two, possible post-war policies to be pursued. Either the economic
problem that had led to the War was to be faced or it was not. If it
was, then the whole problem of industrialism, of the unrestricted use of
machinery, of usury, and the speculation in prices would have to be
dealt with and the social and economic reconstruction of Europe
undertaken from its very basis; for nothing short of this would have
sufficed to lay the foundations of universal peace. But it was not to be
expected that the statesmen, politicians, financiers, and others into
whose hands the arrangement of peace terms fell would voluntarily
undertake such a task. To have done so would have demanded of them a
measure of self-sacrifice that we associate with the lives of the saints
and is altogether incompatible with the struggle for power which is the
central motive of their lives. It was not therefore surprising that they
chose the other alternative, which at the time appeared to them the line
of least resistance, and attempted to prop up the credit of the
Governments and industries of the Allied nations by making Germany pay.
But experience has proved that in spite of the Treaty of Versailles it
is easier said than done; for while on the one hand the only way by
which Germany could possibly pay the indemnity is by increasing her
export trade-the one thing which we at any rate don’t want; on the
other, it has become apparent to even statesmen and financiers that a
solution of the economic problems of the world cannot be postponed
indefinitely. Hence it has been that one international conference after
another—at Washington, Genoa, and the Hague—has been held in attempts to
undo the mischief that was done at Versailles and to get at grips with
the economic situation. Each in turn has been hailed as the liberator,
yet each and all have ended in disappointment, for each in turn has
found itself at the mercy of circumstances too powerful for it. Exactly
how it will all work out it is impossible to foresee. But at the time of
writing France has played her last card and seized the Ruhr, and having
played it she is somewhat perplexed as to what to do next; for it is
already evident that she is going to lose rather than gain by the
adventure. The failure of this policy must end in the defeat of the
Conservatives, who since the War have governed France, and if reports
are to be trusted it will in all probability be followed by a violent
reaction towards the Left, which would seem to be the logical outcome of
the situation; for the disillusionment will be absolute.</p>
<p>Should such prove to be the case, and a Communist or democratic
rising take place, the cause of peace will be enormously strengthened,
for France, which since the War has been the storm centre of Europe,
will have come into line with the rest of the Continent. It will
complete the movement against all constituted power and authority that
has taken place in nations that before the War had adopted conscription,
which began in March 1917 with the successful Revolution in Russia, and
led to the assumption of power by the Bolsheviks. The Bolsheviks, as all
the world knows to-day, were followers of Marx, and they attempted to
reorganise Russian society on a communist basis according to the social
theory that Marx had enunciated. According to that theory, the social
revolution, when it did come, would be the culmination of a long process
of industrial evolution when the mass of the people having become
separated from any ownership of the means of production would become
class-conscious and, suffering from increasing privations and
unemployment, would rise and overthrow the capitalist and ruling class,
take possession of land, capital, and the means of production and
exchange, and organise society for the benefit of all, instead of for
the few. But Russia, where the flames of revolt were first kindled, is
not a highly industrialised country, while the immediate cause of the
revolution was military defeat rather than any issue connected with the
economics of industry. The consequence was, though the Bolsheviks found
themselves in power because they were the only people in the crisis who
were prepared to act with energy and determination, the social theory in
which they put their trust had no relevance whatsoever to the actual
situation with which they were confronted; but being persuaded that
communism was impossible apart from a highly developed industrialism,
they set to work to industrialise Russia, in order, as they imagined, to
render stable the communist organisation which simultaneously they
sought to establish. But instead of rendering communism stable as they
had intended, their activities resulted in provoking a reaction against
both industrialism and communism which ended in a complete defeat of
their policy.</p>
<p>The immediate cause of the defeat of the Bolshevik policy, as all are
well aware, was the famine of 1921. But the ultimate cause lay much
deeper and is connected with the failure of the Bolsheviks to understand
the psychology or to enter into the point of view of the Russian
peasantry. The Russian peasant is Mediaeval, he is religious and
traditional, he has the sense of the soil, he shared in a common life.
In fact, he enjoyed in some degree the very things that Socialists are
supposed to be after. But the Bolsheviks, with their eyes on the future,
and their misunderstanding and contempt of the past, with their belief
in industrialism, their materialist philosophy, and their anti-religious
spirit, failed to see that the foundation was there for them to build
upon. Being orthodox followers of Marx, they believed that the small
farmer and peasant proprietor were doomed to disappear in obedience to
some law of social evolution which never works out as expected; and so,
instead of seeking to shape the traditions of the peasants to more
communal ends by the organisation of agricultural Guilds to maintain
Just and Fixed Prices, they set themselves against the peasantry from
the first. They attacked their religion, while they sought to effect an
immediate transition to complete communism by demanding that the
peasants should relinquish any claim to benefit individually by the
results of their labour. The result of it was that the peasants, finding
their surplus produce requisitioned, while all they got in exchange for
it was paper money which would not buy for them any of the things they
needed, curtailed their production. They began to produce no more food
than was necessary to satisfy their own personal needs, with the result
that when in 1921 the drought came upon them they had no reserves to
fall back upon and famine overtook them. It was this that led to the
defeat of the economic policy of the Bolsheviks.</p>
<p>In a speech delivered to the Russian Congress of Local Organisations
for Political Enlightenment in October 1921,<a href="#fn39" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref39" role="doc-noteref"><sup>39</sup></a>
Lenin frankly admitted the failure and defeat of the economic policy of
the Bolsheviks, which he attributed to their mishandling of the peasants
and failure to create personal interest. So far from having abolished
capitalism and established communism in its place, he confessed that
they had been driven by the force of circumstances to reinstitute
private property except in land and to open the door for the re-entry of
foreign capitalists into Russia, without whose aid they could not get
along. The whole future of Russia resolved itself, in Lenin’s opinion at
the time, into the question as to which party would get the upper hand;
whether the capitalists would succeed in organising themselves, in which
event they would drive out the Bolsheviks, or whether the Bolsheviks,
with the support » of the peasants, would succeed in holding the
capitalists in check.</p>

<p>Events, however, were to prove that Lenin was again mistaken, for the
thing that has happened is a thing that he never even remotely
suspected. For the upshot of it all is that, having broken the power of
the Bolshevik regime, the peasants have conquered. All over Eastern
Europe the Red International is being succeeded by a Green
International. Political parties are outbidding each other for the
support of the peasantry. The large estates have been broken up and the
peasants have got hold of the land, with the result that while urban
populations are being reduced to starvation the rural populations are
becoming prosperous. And this shifting of the centre of political and
economic gravity is being accompanied by the emergence of the peasants’
point of view, which is manifesting itself as hostile to industrialism.
The peasants, we are told, express their abhorrence of it by crossing
themselves three times whenever they speak of the town or the
factory.</p>
<p>This attitude of the peasants towards industrialism I believe to be a
perfectly healthy, natural human instinct, and full of promise for the
future. But to most of the writers in the <em>Manchester Guardian</em>
Special Supplement on “Reconstruction in Europe,” to whom I am largely
indebted for my information on this subject, it is different. They can
see nothing in the rise to power of the peasants but the complete
destruction of all human culture, since to them, with their love of
industrialism, it is the deluge. That immediately the rise to power of
the peasants may exercise an influence detrimental to modernist culture
is not, I think, to be denied; for it is not to be supposed that the
peasants will be more discriminating in their hatred of modernist
culture than our intellectuals have been in their hatred of the
Mediaevalist culture of the peasants. But this does not mean that all
culture will disappear, but that its centre of gravity will be changed
from modernism to Mediaevalism. The modernists have no right to
complain. They are being defeated by the peasants because the peasants
have a grip on reality which they have not. Their defeat is the nemesis
of their intellectual insincerity, of their contempt of reality, their
denial of religion, and their persistent refusal to face the facts of
our industrial system. And because of this the change in the centre of
gravity from modernism to Mediaevalism is all to the good. Before any
further human advance is possible it is urgent that the balance between
town and country, between man and the machine, should be restored. As
our intellectuals, in common with the vast majority of the modern world,
are entirely blind to the necessity, deceiving themselves with fine
phrases about progress and emancipation which mean nothing, it is in the
nature of things that the initiative in society should be transferred to
others.</p>

<h1>XVIII. The Quantitative Stadard</h1>
<p>In a sane and rational society, it may be assumed that the use to
which a force of such unknown potentialities as that of steam power and
machinery should be put would have been a subject of serious
deliberation. Its discovery would have been followed by a patient and
exhaustive inquiry into the probable social, political, and economic
effects of its application, and if its use was permitted it would, in
the first instance, have only been sanctioned for experimental purposes,
while its reactions would have been carefully watched. For though the
undoubted advantages of machinery would have been recognised, men would
not have closed their eyes to the perils to society which might follow
the liberation of such an unknown power. But though the advance of
machinery in its early days appears to have been viewed with some
suspicion and hostility by the workers, because it threatened to
displace their labour, no such apprehensions of danger appear to have
been felt by those in authority, who apparently from the start took the
unrestricted use of machinery for granted. The eighteenth century was an
age of economic individualism, and as there was plenty of money to be
made by using machinery no other consideration was allowed to stand in
the way of its unrestricted use. And so it was that society plunged
light-heartedly into the perils of industrialism, with little thought as
to the future. Owing to the fact that there was a big market demanding
goods in America, the economic effects of machine production were not
immediately felt. But about the year 1806 supply began to get ahead of
demand, and the displacement and depreciation of labour by machinery
began. This upset the wage system—that is, the distribution of
purchasing power by means of payment for work done—precipitating an
economic crisis. The rational thing to have done would have been to
restrict the use of machinery so that it did not interfere with the wage
system or any other of the social and economic traditions of society.
But rational ideas had no particular appeal for that age of reason, and
any hopes of a rational solution were destroyed by the action of the
Government in suppressing the Luddite riots in the year 1811.</p>
<p>For what happened was this. <em>Henceforth the only way of keeping
men in employment was to increase the volume of production with each new
labour-saving invention.</em> This is the key to all subsequent economic
development, frustrating all efforts to stabilise industrialism. For
there is a limit to the possibilities of increased production. Increased
production involves expanding markets. As capitalists refused to allow
labour to share in the increased productivity that machinery brought,
they were compelled to be going ever farther and farther afield in their
search for markets to dispose of their surplus goods, while at the same
time they created competitors for themselves. For no nation can afford
to be a consumer of machine-made goods indefinitely. The suction would
drain its economic resources. Hence it was that one nation after another
that was once our customer was drawn into the vicious circle of
industrial production and became our competitor for markets. But such a
process could not continue indefinitely. A time comes when there are no
new markets left as dumping grounds. When that point was reached, as it
was in the decade before the War, competition rapidly increased in
intensity, until at length the breaking point was reached, and the
economic crisis arrived in Germany that precipitated the War.</p>
<p>As always happens in times of great crisis, there are immediate
causes as well as ultimate ones, and the world sees only the immediate
cause and ignores the ultimate one. Thus the immediate cause of the
economic crisis in Germany that precipitated the Great War can be traced
to the Balkan War, which closed the Balkan markets to her, and to the
fact that after the Agadir crisis of 191 1 the French capitalists
withdrew their loans from Germany, and to the failure of the German
system of credit banks. But the ultimate reason why the crisis made its
appearance in Germany was that, more than any other nation, she had
forced the pace of competition. In the fifteen years before the War
Germany had quadrupled her output. She had increased her use of
machinery to such an extent that production was no longer controlled by
demand, but by plant. Excessive specialisation had brought into
existence a state of things in which it was necessary for financial
reasons to be working always at full pressure. No machine could be
stopped nor any furnace damped down, or the overhead expenses, which
could not be reduced proportionately, would eat up the profits and bring
the whole industrial organisation crashing down, precipitating national
bankruptcy. Thus it came about that production got ahead of demand, and
a day came at last when all the markets accessible to Germany could
absorb no more of her goods. Hence the War. Germany thought that by
making herself militarily supreme she could, by means of indemnities,
restore her finances, get access to new markets and supplies of raw
materials, thereby relieving the pressure of competition that had
brought bankruptcy to her industries. The same cause led to her demand
for colonial expansion and to destroying the towns and industries of
Belgium and Northern France. They had all one object in view—to get more
elbow-room for German industries. And if Germany had succeeded, as she
expected, in bringing the War to an early conclusion, there can be
little doubt but that she would have gained a temporary respite from the
economic troubles that the pursuit of a quantitative standard in
production had brought upon her. But the respite could only have been
temporary, for the central problem remained just where it was, and would
have brought a new crisis in a decade or so later.</p>
<p>If discussion on economic questions had not been boycotted by the
Press, it is possible that when, before the War, it became evident that
the industrial system had reached its limit of expansion because there
were no new markets left to exploit, discussion on this issue would have
engaged popular attention. But as all discussion on real issues had for
some long time previously been suppressed as highbrow talk, there grew
up that maze of false issues that created an atmosphere favourable to
war. By creating a demand for munitions, the War relieved the pressure
of competition that had followed the exhaustion of markets, and this
postponed the reaction by giving the industrial system a new lease of
life. Nowadays the reaction can no longer be postponed, because the
exchanges are dislocated and the markets are shrinking. It is no longer
possible for any country to recover economic prosperity of a kind when
her industries begin to suffer from the competition of machine-made
goods by embarking on an industrial career, and dumping her surplus
goods upon other countries that are not yet industrialised, as was the
custom throughout the nineteenth century. Hence the reaction against
industrialism in India and Eastern Europe, and the various boycotts of
European manufacturers in the East that from time to time are whispered
in the Press. Such boycotts are inevitable. Insistence upon the purchase
of native manufactures presents itself as the easiest way of providing a
livelihood for men who are out of work and starving because of the
competition of foreign manufactures. In countries where the handicrafts
have not disappeared the issue of machine production is as clear as it
was to the Luddites, and we are up against the consequences of the
refusal of our forefathers to face that problem. The problem of
machinery and unemployment that con- fronted the Luddites was not
solved, as the school histories taught us and the average Englishman
supposes, but evaded. The unemployment was transferred from Lancashire
to India. And the means employed to effect this transference was to
suppress the importation of Indian goods to England by the imposition of
prohibitive duties, and to encourage the export of British goods to
India by the imposition of an excise duty upon Indian goods. By such
dodges industrialism was propped up, while the average Englishman,
ignorant of how it was done, came to live in a fool’s paradise,
attributing our national prosperity to the blessings of Free Trade.</p>
<p>I said that the problem that confronted the Luddites was not solved.
In those days it was small and manageable. Nowadays the problem is
universal, as the fact that every country is perplexed by an unemployed
problem bears witness. Nor is the working class the only class that
nowadays is feeling the pinch, for unemployment is becoming almost as
much dreaded by the upper classes as the lower. “What are we to do with
our sons?” is the plaintive wail that recently went up in the columns of
<em>The Times</em> from members of the class accustomed to send its sons
to public schools. And no answer was forthcoming, nor will there be one
until as a nation we repent for our misdoings and have the courage to
face the problem of machinery. Meanwhile attempts are being made to
evade the problem of unemployment by the advocacy of emigration. But to
where? we may reasonably ask, for there is no country in the world that
has not got an unemployed problem of its own. That in any reconstruction
of society the emigration of a part of our population will be necessary
may be true; for as the world market is contracting, our industries will
not in the future be able to provide so much employment as hitherto. But
as an isolated proposition, as a means of escape from the problem caused
by the displacement of labour by machinery, it is mere futility, since
just to the extent that it relieves the burden of unemployment here, it
will intensify it elsewhere.</p>
<p>The unemployed problem must remain insoluble until the problem of
machinery is faced. Nowadays, when not only are there no more new
markets available as dumping grounds, but boycotts are being organised
against industrial wares in the East, it follows that each new
labour-saving invention must tend increasingly to displace manual
labour, and this reacts to overcrowd the professions by reducing the
number of jobs at which it is possible to earn a living. And so the
problem of machinery demands of us a solution, for the system of
distributing purchasing power by means of payment for work done is
clearly breaking down. But it is not the only thing that is breaking
down as a result of the misapplication of machinery, for, as a matter of
fact, every other institution in society is breaking down for the same
reason. All our social and economic traditions are in a state of
disintegration. And as all these problems are organically related to
each other, it will remain impossible to effect a change or reform in
one department of activity apart from the abolition of the subdivision
of labour and a restriction of the use of machinery, which are at the
root of the trouble.</p>
<p>Such considerations would be sufficient to convince us that
industrialism is a blind alley from which we must retrace our steps or
perish. But there is a further consideration which leaves no room for
doubt that the days of industrialism are numbered; and that is the rapid
exhaustion of easily accessible sources of supply of raw materials of
all kinds. Before the age of machines the inroads made by man on
irreplaceable material were moderate, and offered no menace to
posterity. But the machine has an insatiable appetite for fuel and
minerals of all kinds, the supply of which is limited, and which are
being used up at an alarming rate.<a href="#fn40" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref40" role="doc-noteref"><sup>40</sup></a> And this fact, by
necessitating new sources of supply to keep our machines running, has
become a perpetual menace to peace. Hitherto our industrial wars were
undertaken to open up new markets to dispose of our surplus
production—itself a consequence of our refusal to regulate machinery. In
the future, if the situation is not faced, we shall have wars for raw
materials. Since the Armistice, oil has become of ever-increasing
importance as a factor in world politics, determining the course of
diplomacy, and, in the most literal sense of the word, making history.
The industrialised nations, having become increasingly dependent upon
oil as a motive power, must have sources of supply. As existing supplies
are becoming exhausted, a titanic struggle is proceeding behind the
backs of the politicians between American and British interests for the
possession of new oilfields, and Governments and peoples are being
dragged into the quarrel.<a href="#fn41" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref41" role="doc-noteref"><sup>41</sup></a> But why? Because the
modern world will not face the facts of industrialism, because men fail
to see any connection (for example) between war and the increase of
motor transit. The world, it would appear, is determined to use motor
transit more than ever. Yet it is estimated that the known sources of
the supply of oil will be exhausted in twenty-five years’ time at the
most. It is possible, of course, that new sources of supply or some
other motive power may be discovered in the meantime. But supposing they
are not, where shall we be then? There can be but one answer.
Civilisation must collapse, for it will be impossible to breed horses so
rapidly as to effect a speedy return to horse transit. Yet Socialists
and other reformers are entirely uninterested in this question, on which
the whole future of civilisation depends. On the contrary, all they can
see in the great struggle for oil is a reason for abolishing capitalism,
on the assumption, apparently, that if only Socialism were established
oil would be as plentiful as water.</p>

<p>To anyone who will take the trouble to think, it must be apparent
that this “rake’s progress” which we dignify by the name of “industrial
expansion” must come to an end, if not by one means then by another. If
not by wisdom and forethought, by renunciation and repentance—then by
the sword, by more wars and famine and pestilence. For there can, I
think, be no doubt whatsoever that the proximate cause of the War and
the troubles that have followed it are to be found in the quantitative
standard of industrialism, which, obliging each nation that adopted
machine production to pursue a policy of political and economic
expansion, inevitably brought it into collision with other nations
pursuing the same ends. If the world had any sense of political and
economic reality it would long ago have frankly recognised this fact. It
would have faced the fact that military warfare in these days has its
roots in economic warfare, which, in turn, is the consequence of the
quantitative standard of production, and that the restoration of peace
to the world is finally dependent upon the abandonment of the
quantitative standard and its replacement by a qualitative one. But
unfortunately this lesson which the War should have taught us has been
entirely disregarded, and instead of boldly facing the problem, all our
Conservative politicians and industrial magnates can think about is how
to stick to what they have got; and all the Socialist and Labour
politicians can think about is how to dispossess the capitalists; for
neither party exhibits any interest in the problem of industrialism
which lies behind both Conservative and Socialist politics, and which
determines the activities of both. And if we search for the cause of
this extraordinary phenomenon, I think we shall find it in a certain
separation of men from reality that has followed the pursuit of the
quantitative standard. The quantitative standard results in
over-specialisation, and this in turn results in a loss of adaptability.
Among all the symptoms that point to the break-up of the modern world,
.1 think that this loss of adaptability is the most ominous. It suggests
that industrial civilisation is not the fittest to survive.</p>
<p>In a recently published book an American writer, Mr. R. A. Cram, has
some interesting things to say about the consequences of the
quantitative standard. “It is indeed,” he says, “not only the nemesis of
culture, but even of civilisation itself. Out of this gross scale of
things come many other evils; great States subsisting on the subjugation
and exploitation of small and alien peoples; great cities which, when
they exceed more than 100,000 in population, are a menace, and when they
exceed 1,000,000 are a crime; subdivision of labour and specialisation
which degrade men to the level of machines; concentration and
segregation of industries, the factory system, high finance and
international finance, capitalism, and the international standardised
education; metropolitan newspapers, pragmatic philosophy, and churches
‘run on business methods’ and recruited by advertising and ‘publicity
agents.’</p>
<p>“Greater than all, however, is the social poison that affects society
with pernicious anaemia through cutting man off from his natural social
group and making of him an indistinguishable particle in a sliding
stream of grain. Man belongs to his family, ‘his neighbourhood. his
local trade or craft guild, and to his parish church; the essence of
wholesome association is that a man should work with, through, and by
those whom he knows personally—and preferably so well that he calls them
all by their first names. As a matter of fact, to-day he works with,
through, and by individuals whom he probably has never seen, and
frequently would, as a matter of personal taste, hesitate to recognise
if he did see them… The harsh and perilous division into classes and
castes which is now universal, with its development of ’class
consciousness,’ is the direct and inevitable result of this imperial
scale in life which has annihilated the social unit of human scale and
brought in the gigantic aggregations of peoples, money, manufacture, and
labourers, where man can no longer function either as a human unit or an
essential factor in a workable society.”<a href="#fn42" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref42" role="doc-noteref"><sup>42</sup></a></p>

<p>That such things are evil is nowadays generally admitted. Yet it is
not everyone who connects them with the quantitative standard of
industrial production which has been the forerunner of the adoption of
the quantitative standard in other departments of activity. On the
contrary, the majority of reformers look upon these evils as incidental
to a time of transition and capable of reform by external measures, and
fail entirely to see that they are organic with the structure of modern
society and are involved in its activities. Nor can there be a remedy
for such evils so long as the quantitative standard is accepted.
Quantity up to a certain point we must of course have, but we must break
with the theory that exalts a standard of quantity as the final test of
industrial righteousness and substitute for the idea of “maximum
production” the conception of a “sufficient production,” since so long
as we accept the quantitative standard a time will never come when we
have produced enough. Appearances will always be against a return to
sanity, because when production proceeds beyond a certain point it
creates gluts which upsets distribution; and by upsetting distribution
competition is increased and unemployment and poverty is created. The
widespread existence of such poverty in turn lends colour to the demand
for still more production on the assumption that our primary trouble is
an insufficiency of productive power rather than the fact that by
allowing production to run riot we have broken down the system of
distribution. Our economic system is suffering from a kind of chronic
indigestion consequent upon something that might aptly be called
“industrial gluttony.” For just as the glutton, because he eats too much
and fails to profit by the food he consumes, comes to crave for more
food, so we, because we produce too much, fail to profit by our vast
production and call out for more production as the remedy.</p>
<p>Yet if more production is our need, the mystery is however in the
past people managed to exist at all? For if, with productive power
increased a hundredfold, the masses of people are still in poverty, the
existence of human beings on this planet before the introduction of
machinery is a fact impossible of explanation, while the further fact
that all available evidence goes to prove that the mass of people in the
fifteenth century were, as regards the necessaries of life, infinitely
better off than they are to-day<a href="#fn43" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref43" role="doc-noteref"><sup>43</sup></a> suggests that we live
in a madhouse, which is perhaps not far from the truth. There never was
a civilisation in which appearances and reahty were so far apart, and
where appearances count for so much and reahty for so httle. It is this
central fact in our civilisation that makes cataclysms inevitable; for
when men put their whole faith in appearances, the brutality of facts
alone can secure a respect for reality.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the real facts of the situation are concealed from us by
statisticians, who, instead of giving an account of wages and prices
from the Middle Ages onwards to the present day, which would effectually
expose the fallacy of the maximum productionists, invariably make the
end of the eighteenth century the starting point of their calculations
and analyses. On this basis they are able, on the whole, to demonstrate
a slight rise in the standard of comfort of the working class,
continuing until the middle of the nineties, when, for some reason they
cannot explain, it begins to fall. By such means they are able to evade
the inconvenient question as to why the standard of comfort at the end
of the eighteenth century had fallen, as compared with the fifteenth
century, in spite of the largely increased productive power. The answer
to this question gives the clue to the situation, viz. that the fall was
due to the unjust policy which separated the people from the land and to
the defeat of the Guilds, which left the people without protection
against exploitation. From this point of view it would appear that the
demand for increased production was, in the eighteenth century, advanced
as a policy for evading the problems brought about by social injustice.
Just as in our day for precisely the same reason the demand for
increased production was revived during the War, and Socialists, misled
as usual by appearances, fell into the trap; for being destitute of any
such conception as that of “a sufficient production,” which is the
necessary corollary of the qualitative standard, they had no position
from which to attack the heresy.</p>
<p>Among all Biblical incidents the displeasure of God which David
incurred by numbering Israel is one of the most cryptic. But the modern
world offers a most illuminating commentary on it, for we can see only
too clearly to-day how manifold evils have their origin in a
prepossession with numbers. When men are so prepossessed, statisticians
get to work, and they rule out as imponderable everything that cannot be
weighed or measured. And as everything that finally matters in life
cannot be reduced to the terms of one or the other, it comes about
attention is diverted from the things that matter to the things that
don’t, and all quality is thrust out of life. For the same reason the
quantitative standard of production has proved itself to be destructive
of all sense of quality. It is no accident that the arts are to-day
being destroyed. They cannot live in a world of quantitative
standards.</p>

<section id="xix.-machiner-and-the-subdivision-of-labour" class="level1">
<h1>XIX. Machiner and the Subdivision of Labour</h1>
<p>If we are agreed that the quantitative standard of production is
incompatible with social and economic stability, it follows that
everything that is most fundamental in our industrial system is called
in question. If it will not be necessary to abolish entirely the use of
machinery, it will at any rate be necessary to get it into subjection,
and this involves among other things a considerable curtailment of its
use. As to this necessity, Professor Lethaby has some interesting things
to say which will bear quotation.</p>
<p>“The question of machinery,” he says, “is one that troubles many
minds, as well it may. At times I am drawn to the belief that machinery,
gunpowder, electricity are too astounding powers for feeble-willed men
to control; indeed, it is quite thinkable that machinery is the wrecking
force in the world, which will, in fact, be shattered by it. But some
will say, ‘Machinery has come to stay.’ That may be true. Drunkenness
seems to have come to stay, but we have at least to try to control it.
Machine production has, in fact, swiftly changed the character of our
population; and whereas, not many generations ago they were mostly
craftsmen—that is, little artists—they are now an aggregate of machine
tenders, under gangers. These are the sort of facts which political
economists never foresaw. Machinery is such a mighty power that it must
be controlled. No single individual should fire off a powerful machine
for his own profit, any more than he should work a cannon in Oxford
Street to the terror of all well-doers. The owner of machinery must be
licensed to shoot. In truth, machinery is the artillery of commerce, and
it must be controlled by wise generalship. We have as much right to
control any form of machinery as we have to protect ourselves from
firearms… No one should be allowed to pass into ‘brain work,’ such as
stockbroking, without his year of manual drill; and others—Members of
Parliament, architects, and all kinds of pastors and teachers—should, I
think, be asked to have two years to show their good faith. If there
were this basis of actual experience, then perhaps we might hope to
control the machines before they tear civilisation to bits.”<a href="#fn44" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref44" role="doc-noteref"><sup>44</sup></a></p>

</section>
<p>Suggestive as are Professor Lethaby’s words, they yet provide us with
no definite standpoint from which the problem of machinery may be
attacked. And the reason for this, I submit, is that the primary evil is
not to be found in machinery qua machinery, but in the subdivision of
labour, which conflicts with the claims of human personality. The
subdivision of labour preceded the invention of the steam engine and
determined the particular mode of the application of machinery. From
this it follows that if the quantitative standard is to be replaced by a
qualitative one, our attack must not be directed primarily at the use of
machinery, but at the subdivision of labour. Abolish it, and most of the
evils we associate with the use of machinery would automatically
disappear, while such other evils as remained could be easily dealt
with.</p>
<p>But what do we mean by the subdivision of labour? We mean measures
taken to increase the volume of production by the splitting up of a
craft into a number of separate processes which reduce the worker to the
position of an automaton or living machine when his working life comes
to consist in repeating, thousands of times a day, some simple
mechanical movement, like turning a screw. It is this splitting up of a
craft into a number of detailed processes that differentiates the
subdivision of labour from the division of labour. The latter is a
natural and legitimate development, for it increases the possibilities
of human development, while apart from it no civilised society could
exist, for in civilised society no man can supply all his own needs. The
specialisation of men into different trades coincides with the emergence
of civilisation. One man becomes a carpenter, another a weaver, a third
a smith, and so forth. But the subdivision of labour is not called into
existence by the desire of men to live a civilised life, but by the
desire for profits. It dates from the seventeenth century, the classical
example being that eulogised by Adam Smith in <em>The Wealth of
Nation</em>s—namely, pin-making, in which industry it takes twenty men
to make a pin, each man being specialised for a lifetime upon a single
process.</p>
<p>In these days the subdivision of labour is associated with the idea
of “mass production,” and has received a further development in the idea
of “scientific management,” which is to be differentiated from the
subdivision of labour by the fact that, whereas the latter seeks to
increase the volume of production by splitting up a craft into a number
of separate processes, the former attacks the man direct, endeavouring
to secure a larger output by the elimination of such motions of the
arms, legs, and fingers as do not contribute directly to the process of
manufacture. As such it completes the dehumanisation and
despiritualisation of labour begun by the subdivision of labour.</p>
<p>The evil inherent in such methods of production is not merely that
they result in periodic gluts and unemployment, and lead inevitably to
wars, but that such increased productivity is brought about entirely at
the cost of the individual labourer. In the simpler days before the
advent of the subdivision of labour and large-scale production, there
was not the separation between the brain and the hand that there is
to-day. The worker helped to plan and design the work which with his
skill and strength he helped to carry into execution, even when he was
not his own master and able to sell his productions direct to the
public. Working under such conditions, a man found his work a means of
expression; and because of this, work as a rule was the central interest
in his life, providing him with a base for his culture; for craft
culture may be as real a thing as book culture. But such a condition of
work is a thing of the past. Under the factory system all sense of fine
personal creation and fine craftsmanship, all art and ingenuity
disappear. All that is left for the worker is the monotonous details
that inventive genius has been unable to design a machine to do. As the
process of manufacture is carried to a higher and higher degree of
mechanical perfection, the task of the worker becomes increasingly that
of a deadly routine against which all his subconscious instincts rebel;
for the human organism is not adapted to work of this kind. The first
step in this process of degradation was taken when the subdivision of
labour was introduced. It broke the worker into a fragment of a man,
turning him into a mere cog of a machine, and destroyed in him all
interest and pleasure in work by condemning him to a life of drudgery
that operated to stultify and atrophy his natural faculties. Thus the
subdivision of labour came to mean barren monotony for millions of men,
deadening their imagination and robbing them of all sense of creative
joy. It cuts at the roots of human development, thwarting the creative
impulse which is inherent in man, for under such conditions of labour
culture can no longer come to a man through his work, as it came to the
Mediaeval craftsman; and as culture through vocation is for the great
mass of men the only means of approach, it follows that it is vain to
attempt to build up by evening classes and free libraries what the day’s
work is for ever breaking down. Men who are degraded in their work have
no taste or inclination for such a superimposed culture. For culture to
be real must be a part of the life that a man lives, and the only
culture that can be made a part of the life of the industrial worker is
finally the culture of Bolshevism and the class war, for class warfare
is the only activity that can have any appeal to men who are denied
pleasure and interest in their work.</p>
<p>That mechanical work has such an effect on the faculties is nowadays
being recognised by physiologists, psychologists, and educationalists.
Writing on the effect of drills in manual education. Dr. P. B. Ballard
says: “It is well to remember that no habit is got gratuitously. The
price that has to be paid is a loss of adaptability. The nervous system
becomes less plastic, less flexible. All habits are due to the
establishment of new pathways of discharge in the central nervous
system. There is almost certainly an actual growth in the neurones.
Fibrils of communication extended in a specific direction drain off a
previously diffused discharge and rob other parts of the possibility of
exercise. These parts tend to become atrophied and less ready to
function. But a change of external conditions may render the functioning
of these weaker parts desirable. It will thus be seen that the
specialised nerve growth, by monopolising nutriment and exercise, has
caused a deterioration in other elements, and renders more difficult the
formation of new habits. In other words, there has been a loss of
flexibility.”<a href="#fn45" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref45" role="doc-noteref"><sup>45</sup></a></p>

<p>If Dr. Ballard could say this merely of the effect of drills as a
part of manual education, what could he have said of a system of
production which consists of nothing else? I propose, therefore, to
supplement what Dr.  Ballard has said by some editorial comments of
<em>American Medicine</em> on the effects of scientific management:</p>
<p>” Working along with his partner, the efficiency engineer, the
speeder-up has managed to obtain from the factory worker a larger output
in the same period of time. This is done by eliminating the so-called
superfluous motions of the arms and fingers—i.e. those which do not
contribute directly to the fashioning of the article under process of
manufacture… The movements thought to be superfluous simply represent
Nature’s attempt to rest the strained and tired muscles. Whenever the
muscles of the arms and fingers, or of any part of the body for that
matter, undertake to do a definite piece of work, it is physiologically
imperative that they do not accomplish it by the shortest mathematical
route. A rigid to-and-fro movement is possible only to machinery;
muscles necessarily move in curves, and that is why grace is
characteristic of muscular movement and is absent from a machine. The
more finished the technique of a workman and the greater his strength,
the more graceful are his movements, and, what is more important in this
connection, vice versa. A certain flourish, superfluous only to the
untrained eye, is absolutely characteristic of the efficient workman’s
motions.</p>
<p>“Speeding-up eliminates grace and the curved movements of
physiological repose, and thus induces an irresistible fatigue, first in
small muscles, second in the trunk, ultimately in the brain and nervous
system. The early result is a fagged and spiritless worker of the very
sort that the speeder-up’s partner—the efficiency engineer—will be
anxious to replace by a younger and fresher candidate, who, in his turn,
will soon follow his predecessor if the same relentless process is
enforced.”<a href="#fn46" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref46" role="doc-noteref"><sup>46</sup></a></p>

<p>But the evil does not end with the mutilation of the workers. It
spreads upwards, inducing a psychical and economic reflex that brings
unspeakable confusion into every department of life and activity.
Immediately it replaces the old vertical social divisions, which, based
upon differences of function, were flexible in their nature, by
horizontal class divisions, which, based upon differences of wealth, are
rigid and accompanied by a confusion of function where they are not
divorced from it. Then it invades the intellectual processes, replacing
the old categories based upon conceptions of quality by categories based
upon conceptions of quantity, while it encourages the growth of
specialisation in every department of activity. To such a degree had
specialisation in the intellectual sphere proceeded in Germany before
the War that it is said that every individual became a monomaniac on his
own subject, while he was largely ignorant of every other, to the
detriment of general culture. For the intellectual specialist, by
developing one side of his mind at the expense of the other sides, tends
to lose balance, and his judgments are apt to be anything but reliable.
This was the Kultur that gave to the Germans their sense of superiority
over other people and was a contributory cause of the War. It would not
be true to ascribe the development of specialisation in the department
of intellectual activity entirely to the institution of the subdivision
of labour, for the tendency existed before the seventeenth century, and
is to be traced ultimately to the intellectual forces set in motion by
the Renaissance, which, by substituting universality for unity as the
aim of education, promoted specialisation; for as it is impossible for
any single individual to be universal, with such an aim the field of
thought became inevitably divided among many specialists. All the same,
there is no doubt that the subdivision of labour has, by its reactions,
increased this tendency, for it has created mechanical problems that
favour the growth of mechanics. It reacts also to create metallurgical,
physical and chemical problems. Thus natural science flourishes, and the
methods of science and the prestige of science lead to their application
in other departments of activity, with results that are disastrous, as
the present intellectual confusion bears witness.</p>
<p>The end of it all is social, moral, intellectual, and spiritual
disintegration. All bonds are being sundered, for things which were once
united are everywhere resolving themselves into their component parts.
The labourer is divorced from the soil, the arts from the crafts,
personality from industry, property from function, function from
responsibility, money from values, power from knowledge, knowledge from
opportunity, the material from the spiritual. Moreover, specialisation
leads to complexity, complexity to confusion, and confusion leads to
misunderstandings and suspicions, and suspicions harden into class
hatred and warfare. Thus all sense of a common tradition, of a common
mind and a common life knit together by personal and human ties is
dissolved. Literature and art, instead of being vehicles of expression
for common and universal ideas, become expressions of the idiosyncrasies
of egoists, and instead of links joining people together, become
barriers to separate them. Finally, the human personality itself begins
to disintegrate, for a point is reached in the development of complexity
when the human mind loses all grip on the basic facts of life. The
individual can no longer respond to the demands that are made on his
wits and sympathies. He becomes listless, indifferent, apathetic—the
fate of the modern man. Thus we see all human development is arrested.
Man, by his energy, his inventiveness, and his avarice, has brought into
existence a system of production that can only function at the expense
of the individual and in an environment so monstrous and complex that it
baffles and masters him. It is the old story of the Frankenstein monster
over again. Man has created an environment that threatens to destroy
him.</p>
<p>Once we realise that what is popularly known as Progress is nothing
less than a process of internal disintegration in which all the things
that God joined together have become fatally separated, it becomes
evident that the most fundamental requisite of any scheme of social
reconstruction is to bring together again the things that have become
divided—to abolish the subdivision of labour and the use of machinery,
in so far as it serves such quantitative ends. But if the current of
economic development is to be reversed, it is essential that we take our
stand on the truth of the principles of Christianity, for there is no
other way of replacing the quantitative standard, which involves the
subdivision of labour, by a qualitative one. It cannot be done so long
as men accept the point of view of Socialist and materialist economics,
because the Socialist qua Socialist thinks only of the distribution of
wealth. He reasons in quantities, and as the subdivision of labour
increases the volume of production there is not, from the point of view
of Socialist economics, any valid objection to it—the assumption being
that the more wealth there is produced the more there will be to divide.
That, as a matter of fact, any increase of wealth obtained by such means
defeats its own ends, inasmuch as it places the workers at the mercy of
capitalists, who are in a position to prevent any such redistribution of
wealth, is not admitted in Socialist theory. And it can never be
admitted, because it is a conclusion that can be deduced from
psychology, but not from economics. Such considerations lead us to the
inevitable conclusion that the clue to the social problem is to be found
in psychology rather than in economics, and it is for this reason that a
revival of Christianity is necessary to any solution of the social
problem; for it is only when we approach this question from the point of
view of personality, only if we believe in the aboriginal and
imperishable worth of the individual, that we can have any grounds for
objecting to the subdivision of labour. The subdivision of labour can be
condemned on Christian grounds, because it treats men as economic units
of production instead of as individuals with souls to be saved, but it
cannot be condemned on economic grounds because it does increase the
volume of production. As Christians we can maintain that any increase of
wealth obtained by such means carries with it a curse, because it
violates the sanctity of personality, and therefore demand its
abolition. But such an argument is invalid from the point of view of
Socialist theory, which approaches social questions from the point of
view of the quantity of goods produced rather than from that of the
quality of the life to be lived.</p>

<section id="xx.-the-foundation-in-labor" class="level1">
<h1>XX. The Foundation in Labor</h1>
<p>The attitude that reformers assume towards the subdivision of labour
is ultimately the thing that divides them into different schools of
thought; for it is the thing that determines their attitude towards
everything else. It is the economic issue that separates the
Mediaevalists from the modernists. The Fabian Essayists, following Adam
Smith, accepted the subdivision of labour as a boon to mankind, because
it increased the volume of production, whilst ignoring its moral and
psychological implications, to the evils of which they were apparently
blind. Ruskin, on the contrary, condemned it in language that admits of
no equivocation as an unmitigated curse, inasmuch as it dehumanised and
despiritualised the workers. But the attitude which is the most
significant and most perverse is that of Marx; for he welcomes it with
his eyes wide open, because it encourages class warfare, which he
persuaded himself was the dynamic law of history.</p>
<p>As in a previous chapter I have dealt with the fallacies of “maximum
production,” it will not be necessary for me to controvert the Fabian
attitude, and we may proceed to consider that of Marx, which is of
fundamental importance to us. In connection with the subdivision of
labour he says:</p>
<p>“Within the capitalist system all methods for raising the social
productiveness of labour are brought about at the cost of the individual
labourer; all means for the development of production transform
themselves into means of domination over, and exploitation of, the
producers; they mutilate the labourer into a fragment of a man, degrade
him to the level of an appendage of a machine, destroy every remnant of
charm in his work, and turn it into hated toil; they estrange him from
the intellectual potentialities of the labour-process in the same
proportion as science is incorporated in it as an independent power;
they distort the conditions under which he works, subject him during the
labour-process to a despotism the more hateful for its meanness; they
transform his life-time into working-time, and drag his wife and child
beneath the wheels of the Juggernaut of Capital.”<a href="#fn47" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref47" role="doc-noteref"><sup>47</sup></a></p>

</section>
<p>I confess that when I first read this passage it took my breath away.
Before reading it I had assumed that Marx, like the Fabians, was one of
those mechanically minded people who are blind to the human degradation
that the subdivision of labour involves. But such apparently was not the
case. For his words, which might have been written by Ruskin, testify to
the fact that he was fully alive to the essentially degrading nature of
such a method of production. Yet instead of demanding its abolition like
Ruskin, instead of facing the problem as a clear issue between right and
wrong, he was so obsessed with the idea of evolution, according to which
the subdivision of labour was to be regarded as a necessary stage in
social and economic development, and with the idea of class warfare
which it encouraged and which he persuaded himself was the dynamic law
of history, that considerations of right and wrong, of humanity and
inhumanity, became in his mind matters of quite secondary importance
which could not be allowed to impede the path of progress.</p>
<p>But truth will out, if not in theory then in practice. For it is
interesting to observe that one of the causes of the defeat of the
Bolshevik regime in Russia is to be found in their essentially wrong
attitude towards the subdivision of labour and scientific management;
for, on Lenin’s own confession, failure to create personal interest was
the ultimate rock on which Communism foundered, though the famine was
the immediate cause of failure; and there is no room for doubt that this
failure was as intimately connected with the introduction of scientific
management and labour conscription into Russia by the Communists as with
the abolition of private property to which Lenin ascribed it. That the
introduction of such methods of production and organisation would have a
demoralising effect was clearly foreseen by the Mensheviks. They saw in
them something that was incompatible with the Communist ideal, as we
know from a speech delivered by Lenin in 1918 to the plenary sitting of
the Central Executive Committee of the Soviets, when he quotes them as
saying: “The introduction of scientific management and labour
conscription, except in connection with the re-establishment of
capitalism, cannot increase the productivity of labour; on the contrary,
it will lessen labour’s self-reliance and organising activities; it
threatens to enslave labour, and to arouse the dissatisfaction of the
most backward classes.” But Lenin maintained that such would not be the
case. “If it were true,” he said, “then our revolution with its
Socialist ideals would be on the eve of collapse… I should consider the
revolution as lost if it were not for the knowledge that those who
reason thus belong to a small and uninfluential group, and that no
assembly of class-conscious workers would endorse such opinions… What,”
he asks, “has made these people forsake reality for formulas?” Yet the
predictions of the “small and uninfluential group” proved to be right,
as Lenin himself subsequently found out. For the Mensheviks proved to be
right in believing that scientific management and labour conscription
were incompatible with a Communist society, or for that matter with any
decent social order.</p>
<p>Now the whole issue between Mediaevalism and modernism, between a
Christian sociology and Socialist economics, will be found to turn on
the attitude we adopt towards the subdivision of labour. If out of
timidity we acquiesce in it, then I contend that disaster will overtake
any efforts we may make to establish a new social order, as it overtook
the Bolsheviks in Russia. On the contrary, if as Christians we demand
its abolition, because of its contempt of personality, we are inevitably
committed to the Mediaevalist position. For once we make such a complete
break with present-day methods of production there is no stopping until
we get back to the Middle Ages—anti-Mediaeval prejudice notwithstanding;
for in that case we break with the empirical attitude towards social
questions and take our stand on the elemental needs of human nature.</p>
<p>Among such elemental needs none is more urgent than this, the reform
of work. If ever again work is to be honoured and respected, it must be
real, wholesome work in which men can find joy and expression, and this
involves the abolition of the subdivision of labour and such machinery
as conflicts with the claims of personality and art. “Work,” says
Professor Lethaby, “as the first necessity of life, has to be recognised
as the centre of gravity of the whole social structure, for everything
in a sound and developing society should be seen in relation to
productive work. Brain work, sciences, fine arts, may all be noble and
beneficial, but only in so far as they are functions of the common
society and part of a steady development of the great body of those who
toil.”<a href="#fn48" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref48" role="doc-noteref"><sup>48</sup></a> Or, as he put it another way: “As
work is the first necessity of existence, the very centre of our moral
system, so a proper recognition of work is the necessary basis for all
right religion, art, and civilisation, since society became diseased in
direct ratio to its neglect or contempt of labour.”<a href="#fn49" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref49" role="doc-noteref"><sup>49</sup></a></p>

<p>Failure to perceive this central truth in life is at the root of the
failure of reform activities of all kinds. Reformers have invariably
approached social questions from the point of view of leisure rather
than work, the attainment of leisure being regarded by them as a
precedent condition of the attainment of all the other good things of
life. Art, culture, enjoyment, opportunity—everything, in fact, that
makes life worth living—being supposed to be dependent upon leisure.
Hence the attainment of leisure has been made one of the immediate
objectives of reform activity; the assumption being that if only leisure
could be secured for the masses an atmosphere would be created
favourable to the revival of art and culture.</p>
<p>Now on first acquaintance it may seem impossible not to support such
an aim. There is no doubt whatsoever that lack of leisure is for the
masses one of their greatest handicaps. Yet when we look into the matter
more closely we find that, so far as the majority is concerned, the
trouble is not so much that they suffer from a lack of leisure as that
under industrialism their work is of such a nature that it cannot be
done in a leisurely way. It is not lack of leisure, but mechanical
labour that is one of the great obstructions in the path of art and
culture; and it will not be removed merely by increasing the amount of
time in which people are not obliged to work at all. On the contrary, so
long as work remains monotonous and hurried as it is to-day, there is no
reason to suppose that if leisure were increased it would be followed,
so far as the majority are concerned, by any revival of interest in art
and culture. They would use it in the same way that they use their
leisure to-day—in the pursuit of pleasure. If people had more money and
more leisure they would demand more amusements and luxurious living, the
women would waste more money on dress, and the men would provide the
motor- cars. Vulgarity in every direction would be increased. There can
be no doubt as to what would happen; for anyone who has been to America
knows only too well how industrialised citizens prefer to spend their
money and leisure. It is in the nature of things that this should be so.
For culture, as I have before said, is not something added to life, but
a necessary part of the life a man lives. It has its basis in work. If
men are turned into machines, or are engaged in occupations that
separate them from primary realities, then their life is corrupted at
its roots, and it would matter little if the work was reduced to four or
even two hours a day, the corruption would be there all the same, and it
would corrupt the leisure that accompanies it. But, as a matter of fact,
there is no prospect whatsoever of the leisure of the workers being
increased under industrialism, except in the form of unemployment,
because the practical effect of every increase in the use of machinery
is not to increase leisure but competitive waste, and competitive waste
builds up powerful vested interests that benefit by its continuance;
such, for instance, as railway companies, who profit by
cross-distribution, and the advertising trades, which batten on
overproduction. The tendency of vested interests of this type to
increase stands in the way of any reduction of the hours of labour
beyond that required to produce the maximum output, and explains why in
spite of the enormous increase in production the mass of workers to-day
are infinitely poorer than in the Middle Ages.</p>
<p>Sufficient has perhaps now been said to demonstrate the insufficiency
of leisure as a reformist aim, and why the centre of gravity of
reformist activities must be found in an ideal of work—of work that is
of a real and wholesome nature. Yet, after all, it is not surprising
that Socialists should have fallen into the error of supposing that
salvation is to be found in an increase of leisure, when we remember
that the ideal of leisure is a part of our cultural tradition. That
tradition is derived from the Greeks, and, as Professor Lethaby has
wisely remarked, the problems which the Greeks first propounded and
which philosophers have ever since gone turning round and round were the
problems that interested men of leisure in a civilisation based upon
slavery; or, in other words, philosophy really was the thinking of those
who had the necessaries of life provided for them.<a href="#fn50" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref50" role="doc-noteref"><sup>50</sup></a>
It follows that such philosophies are in their nature limited. They can
in no sense be regarded as adequate philosophies of life, for any
philosophy that would attempt to grapple with the problem of life as a
whole must be a philosophy that concerns the poor man as much as the
rich. And for this reason it must have its foundation in work, because
the necessity of labour lies at the basis of every society. Work, then,
and not leisure, must be the starting point of any philosophy of life
and society, and everything in a sound and developing society must be
appraised according as to whether or not it increases the opportunities
of man for expression through work. Only when normal and healthy
conditions of work obtain will a society be stable and permanent, and
art and culture function beneficially in its midst.</p>

<p>If this principle were accepted—and considering that throughout the
Middle Ages work, and not wealth and leisure, was regarded as the
bestower of all worth and dignity—there seems to be no reason why
Christians to-day should not accept it, then it follows that we have no
option but to renounce industrialism, for it is built upon a denial of
the sanctity of work and personality, and to return to that conception
of social economy and well-being which had its foundations in
agriculture rather than in trade and commerce, of which we read:</p>
<p>“Among manual industries none stood higher in the estimation of the
Canon law than agriculture. It was looked upon as the mother and
producer of all social organisation, and culture, as the fosterer of all
other industries, and consequently as the basis of material well-being.
The Canon law exacted special consideration for agriculture, and, partly
for this reason, that it tended in a higher degree than any other branch
of labour to teach those who practised it godly fear and uprightness.
‘The farmer,’ so it is written in <em>A Christian Admonition</em>, ‘must
in all things be protected and encouraged, for all depends upon his
labour, from the Emperor to the humblest of mankind, and his handiwork
is in particular honourable and well-pleasing to God.’ Therefore both
the spiritual and secular law protect him.</p>
<p>“Next to agriculture came handiwork. ‘This is praiseworthy in the
sight of God, especially in so far as it represents necessary and useful
things.’ And when the articles are made with care and art, then both God
and men take pleasure in them; and it is good and true work when
artistic men, by the skill and cunning of their hands, in beautiful
building and sculpture, spread the glory of God and make men gentle in
their spirits, so that they find delight in beautiful things, and look
reverently on all art and handicraft as a gift of God for use,
enjoyment, and edification of mankind.</p>
<p>“Trade and commerce were held in lower esteem. ‘An honourable
merchant,’ says Trithemius, ‘who does not only think of large profits,
and who is guided in all his dealings by the laws of God and man, and
who gladly gives to the needy of his wealth and earnings, deserves the
same esteem as any other worker. But it is no easy matter to be always
honourable in mercantile dealings, and with the increase of gain not to
become avaricious. Without commerce no community, of course, can exist,
but immoderate commerce is rather hurtful than beneficial, because it
fosters greed of gain and gold, and enervates and emasculates the nation
through love of pleasure and luxury.’</p>
<p>“The Canonical writers did not think it was conducive to the
well-being of the people that the merchants ‘like spiders should
everywhere collect together and draw everything into their webs.’ With
the ever-increasing growth and predominance of the mercantile spirit
before their eyes, they were sufficiently justified in their
condemnation of the tyranny and iniquity of trade, which, as St. Thomas
Aquinas had already said, made all civic life corrupt, and by the
casting aside of good faith and honesty opened the door wide to
fraudulence; while each one thought only of his personal profit without
regard to the public good.”<a href="#fn51" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref51" role="doc-noteref"><sup>51</sup></a></p>

<p>It was for such reasons that the Mediaeval economists deprecated any
politico-economic movement that encouraged the people to give up the
pursuit of agriculture for trade and commerce. Four centuries of
activity, based upon the opposite assumption that wealth and leisure
rather than useful and conscientious work should be the aim of industry,
has done nothing more than to justify the suspicion and hostility with
which in the Middle Ages such activities were regarded.</p>

<section id="xxi.-science-and-civilisation" class="level1">
<h1>XXI. Science and Civilisation</h1>
<p>We have insisted that in any sound and developing society it would be
necessary for “work to be recognised as the first necessity of life, as
the centre of gravity of the whole social structure.” As opposed to the
ideal of leisure, the ideal of work may be a valid one. Yet it is
apparent that work in itself is insufficient as an ideal, since until we
have defined for ourselves the final aims of life we have no guarantee
that it will not be misdirected. In this connection it may be observed
that the evils which we associate with industrialism could never have
reached their present proportions but for much disinterested work,
generously given by scientists and inventors; and what is still more
serious is that the most serious perils that confront civilisation
to-day, as, for instance, poison gas and bombing planes, not to mention
the threatened release of sub-atomic energy, do not owe their existence
to greed and avarice, which we justly condemn, but to the labours of
scientists and inventors, often undertaken at great personal
sacrifice.</p>
<p>There are scientists who are genuinely alarmed at the later
developments of science. Unless society can find measures to control
successfully the knowledge that science has placed at its disposal,
unless there is sufficient moral and intellectual power in the community
to ensure that scientific knowledge is used for the well-being of
society instead of for the purposes of destruction, then the less we
have to do with science the better. This point of view has recently been
given dramatic expression by Miss Cicely Hamilton in a recent novel,<a href="#fn52" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref52" role="doc-noteref"><sup>52</sup></a> in which she predicts the
destruction of modern civilisation as a result of the alliance of
science with passion. She comes to the startling conclusion “that man,
being by nature destructive, can only survive when his powers of
destruction are limited,” while she sees in the fear of knowledge and
inquiry which in the past was associated with religious beliefs an
essential need of the race, inasmuch as it expressed the instinct of
self-preservation. The fear of knowledge was not due to mere prejudice
and bigotry, but to a dim race memory of evils that in the past had
overtaken society when the barrier between science and emotion had been
removed and knowledge claimed as the right of the multitude. The perils
that confronted society to-day were not new. They had been experienced
in forgotten generations, and their memory was preserved for us in myth
and folklore. To Theodore Savage, who had seen civilisation laid waste
by the agency of science combined with human passion, myth and folklore
had become real: “The dragon that wasted a country with its breath—how
else could a race that knew naught of chemistry account for the devilry
of gas? And he understood now why the legend of Icarus was a story of
disaster, and why Prometheus, who stole the fire from heaven, was
chained to eternity for his daring; he knew also why the angel with a
flaming sword barred the gate of Eden to those who had tasted the tree
of knowledge… The story of the Garden, of the Fall of Man, was no more
the legend of his youth; he read it now, with his opened eyes, as a
livid and absolute fact. A fact told plainly as symbol could tell it by
a race that had put from it all memory of the science, whereby it was
driven from its ancient paradise, its garden of civilisation… How many
times since the world began had man mastered the knowledge that should
make him like unto God, and turned, in agony of mind and body, from a
power synonymous with death?”</p>

<p>Let us hope that Miss Hamilton’s forecast of the future is an
exaggeration. But that she probes a real issue and faces the peril that
confronts us with courage is, I think, unquestionable and exhilarating
in an age that hopes to survive by cultivating the arts of evasion.
“Knowledge is evil,” says an Eastern proverb, and we have yet to prove
it to be untrue; for the spirit of evasion that characterises men
to-day, reformers included, does not encourage us to hope that the evil
will be mastered and turned into good. For whenever the issue of science
and mechanical production is raised, as a rule all we can get from
reformers are fine sentiments about “not being prepared to surrender all
that science has brought to us or to regard it as merely the working of
the powers of darkness,” and about “capturing the astounding
achievements of the human spirit,” and that kind of thing, which in
practical effect means that the powers of darkness are not to be
interfered with, on the assumption, apparently, that evil will eventuate
in good if it be allowed to proceed unchecked.</p>
<p>But will it? Evidence accumulates daily to prove that such will not
be the case, for science allied with mechanism on one side and with
passion on the other exhibits a spirit that is not only increasingly
hostile to all the interests of mankind but to the very existence of
civilisation. In former times a natural boundary was put to the
possibilities of social and industrial development by man’s ignorance of
the powers and forces of nature. He was protected from the worst
extremes of destructive nihilism by his very limitations. By the sweat
of his brow he not only earned his bread, but he was kept in a close and
sympathetic relationship with the primary facts of life and nature. But
science, in unlocking the secrets of nature, removed the old
limitations. It presented man with a gift that could have relieved him
of his more arduous toil on two conditions—that he kept his head, and
that his moral development kept step with his technical discoveries; for
only on such terms could all the flames of emotion and selfish passion,
which experience proves are so destructive when allied to science, be
kept in a strict subjection. Unfortunately, however, the perils of
science were not foreseen. The average man was so completely hypnotised
by machinery that he entirely lost his head, while scientists were so
enamoured of their own discoveries that they somehow seemed to imagine
that science itself might become a substitute for morality, as would
appear from the very naive way in which they were apt to assume that the
only obstacle in the path of the millennium was the scantiness of
nature. Thus it came about that science, instead of allying itself with
religion and submitting to be controlled for the better service of
mankind, became the instrument of power, avarice, and passion, while the
majority, surrounded by the wonders of science and technology, of all
sorts of complicated machines in daily use, living among changes which
followed each other with such startling rapidity, lost their bearings
completely, and became the easy victims of exploitation and oppression.
Effective resistance to their growing enslavement and insecurity was
frustrated by a theory of Socialism which, by concentrating popular
attention on the evils of capitalism, blinded men to the still more
fundamental evils of which modern capitalism is but a symptom.</p>
<p>But these more fundamental evils must be attacked if civilisation is
to survive. We must frankly recognise that knowledge may be just as
easily an agent for evil as for good. Nay, more easily; since pursued as
an end in itself, apart from any consideration of the higher interests
of mankind it is supposed to serve, experience proves that it can only
too readily be exploited for selfish ends. The reason for this is to be
found in the fact that the man bent upon selfish ends can always get to
work more quickly than the man who would serve a higher purpose or takes
a longer view of things. We conclude therefore that unless science is
subject to rigid control that will prevent its abuse it will continue to
be used for evil purposes.</p>
<p>But if science is to be controlled, the question arises as to what
authority is going to control it. Here we find ourselves in deep waters,
for it raises a question which is urgent but to which there is no
immediate answer. There is no answer to-day because the exercise of
authority at any time depends upon the existence within the community of
a certain consensus of opinion as to the kind of authority it is
necessary to exercise. And as no such consensus of opinion as to the
kind of control to which science should be subjected exists to-day, it
is obviously impossible for any person or body to exercise any authority
in the matter. In these circumstances it would appear that the only
thing to be done is to educate public opinion, since until people can be
brought to see the perils inherent in permitting certain forms of
knowledge to be common property nothing can be done. And this enforces
upon us the need of a changed ideal of life, for until people are in
possession of some definite standard of values other than the material,
they will not be able to see how the problem could be handled, while to
forbid knowledge except in the interests of some higher truth or
revelation would inevitably appear stupid and arbitrary.</p>
<p>Meanwhile it is possible that history may repeat itself and that the
scientific knowledge that has become so perilous to civilisation may be
lost in a new Dark Age, the near approach of which already appears as
imminent. Or it may be that science will disappear from the modern world
as it did from the ancient world, not because the knowledge of it was
suppressed, but because with the spread of Christianity interest was
diverted from the natural to the supernatural world, for when men become
interested in values that are eternal they have not the same keen
interest in things transitory. There are many signs that the world is
about to move in some such direction. We must in the first place
recognise that belief in materialism is on the decline; in the next that
popular belief in the beneficence of science has been” largely dispelled
by the fact that during the War it so readily lent itself for the
purposes of destruction; then we have to reckon with the fact that the
increasing complexity of science makes it every year more difficult to
follow, and because of this it may fall into the same contempt as the
speculations of the schoolmen fell in the Middle Ages; and again, that
scientists have already lost that confident belief in their mission—a
sure presage of decline; and finally because there is abundant evidence
that, as in the latter days of the Roman Empire, interest is to-day
being diverted from the natural to the supernatural. It is impossible to
read the story of the early centuries of Christianity without feeling
that history is beginning again to repeat itself, for a process of
spiritual and psychological change is taking place in the mind of the
world to-day in all respects analogous to the change that took place in
the latter days of the Roman Empire. The modern world, like the Pagan,
is being disenchanted of materialism, it has been shaken by its
perception of the inadequacy of a purely intellectual interpretation of
the universe, and there has occurred a corresponding influx of Eastern
ideas which has awakened an interest in the mystical, the psychic, and
the occult, of which the East is the perennial source; for it is well to
remember that all the modern cults and sects interested in these things,
the Theosophists, the Spiritualists, and the Christian Scientists had
their parallels in the Gnostics, the Neo-Platonists. and Manichaeans of
ancient Rome. And what is still more interesting is that the fusion of
Eastern and Western thought in Rome was followed by the triumph of
Christianity. Does it not look as if the same thing is again about to
happen, and that the spiritual movement on the one hand and the social
movement on the other are preparing the way for the acceptance of
Christianity, which, being both spiritual and material, can alone give
coherence and definiteness to the vague spiritual and social impulses of
our time?</p>
</section>
<section id="xxii.-the-practical-application" class="level1">
<h1>XXII. The Practical Application</h1>
<p>We have in the preceding chapters stated the principles upon which a
Christian sociology should rest. It remains for us to suggest the lines
of their practical application.</p>
<p>In this connection it is to be observed that a precedent condition of
any really effective action must be a willingness to face the fact that
our industrial system is doomed, that a process of disintegration is
taking place which, unless it can be checked, sooner or later must
result in collapse, since apart from such a frank recognition it is
certain that the real issues will not be faced. This will especially be
the case with the unemployed problem, for unless we realise that
industrialism is doomed we shall be unwilling to recognise it as the
inevitable consequence of the misapplication of machinery. This
unwillingness to-day renders our handling of the unemployed problem not
merely contradictory but idiotic. Hitherto the defence of the
unrestricted use of machinery rested on the belief that in the long run
it would emancipate mankind from the necessity of labour, since by
reducing work to a minimum it would set men free to follow the higher
pursuits of life. As to whether most of those who claim to have been so
liberated show any disposition to follow such higher aims I do not for
the moment inquire; but it is to be observed that nowadays when this
prophecy that machinery is destined to liberate man from the necessity
of toil shows some signs of being fulfilled, when for the moment we have
produced enough and to spare, we are panic-stricken at the army of
unemployed in our streets, and straightway organise demonstrations to
find them some work to do. The situation is grotesque in the extreme,
and were it not so tragic it would be laughable; for the utterly idiotic
attitude of mind it reveals is perhaps without parallel in history. The
modern man has had his dreams fulfilled, and he awakens to find the
fulfilment is a nightmare. Yet he goes on dreaming—it never occurring to
most reformers to connect the problem of unemployment with the problem
of machinery—and this, in spite of the fact that it was to find a
solution of the problem created by the displacement of labour by
machinery at the time of the Luddite riots that led to the speculations
of Robert Owen, which laid the foundation of Socialist thought and
brought the movement into existence.<a href="#fn53" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref53" role="doc-noteref"><sup>53</sup></a> In the course of a
century the Socialist movement has not only entirely lost sight of the
problem it originally set out to solve and around which its social
theory originally took shape, but nowadays actually denies that any such
problem of machinery exists.</p>
<section class="footnotes footnotes-end-of-block" role="doc-endnotes">
<ol start="53">
<li id="fn53" role="doc-endnote"><p>See my <em>Post-Industrialism</em>
(Allen &amp; Unwin, 6s.), where the bearing of the problem of machinery
on Socialist theory is developed.<a href="#fnref53" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>
</ol>
</section>
<p>Yet the problem must be faced. Apart from the larger problem of the
destruction of our social and cultural traditions which we saw had
followed the unrestricted use of machinery on a basis of the subdivision
of labour, is it not apparent that apart from some restriction to its
use it is impossible to keep men in employment? This fact was clearly
recognised by Marx, who saw that the end of the industrial system would
coincide with the appearance of a large and insoluble problem of
unemployment. He saw in the unemployed the nucleus of the new world
order, proposing to use them for the purpose of overthrowing the
capitalist system by means of a proletarian revolution. But experience
proves that class warfare is sterile. It is capable of destroying the
existing order of society, but not of creating anything to take its
place—an experience that should not surprise us considering that the
principles of Marx conflict with those of the Gospel. But if we are of
the opinion that Marx was mistaken in supposing that a new social system
could be heralded by means of revolution, we nevertheless feel that he
was instinctively right in recognising in the unemployed the nucleus of
the new world order, and we are confirmed in our opinion by the
experience of Guild development. Odon Por tells us that the outstanding
feature of the Italian Producing Guilds is that they originated in the
first instance to relieve unemployment<a href="#fn54" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref54" role="doc-noteref"><sup>54</sup></a>—an experience which has been
repeated here, since apart from the Building Guild, which owed its
creation to the housing shortage, all the other Producing Guilds have
had the same origin.</p>

Italy</em>, by Odon Por.<a href="#fnref54" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>
</ol>
</section>
<p>But it is not sufficient merely to organise the unemployed in
Producing Guilds, for it is apparent that it will be precisely where
unemployment is greatest, as in the engineering trades, that it will be
most difficult to organise such Guilds because of the slump in demand on
the one hand and the enormous plant and capital required on the other.
To grapple therefore with the problem it is necessary to take a wider
view—to train the unemployed in such ways that they may become citizens
of the post-industrial society. In other words, believing that the
industrial system is doomed and the day of universal markets is coming
to an end, we propose to turn the unemployed into agriculturalists and
handicraftsmen. There should be no more difficulty about this, if it
were undertaken in a public way, than there was during the War of
turning civilians into soldiers. It is entirely a question of will and
determination. Attempts in the past to deal with the unemployed have
invariably failed, and no wonder, for they have been the last word in
futility. The only idea behind the various schemes for dealing with them
has been to make work, to mark time, as it were, until trade revived.
Such an aim inspires nobody. The unemployed themselves are conscious of
the futility of the work upon which they are engaged, and this sense of
futility is demoralising in the last degree. But if the fact that the
industrial system is doomed was frankly faced, and the unemployed were
given a craft or agricultural training to enable them to take their
place in the new social order, a different spirit would come to prevail.
Their work would come to have meaning for them, and this would make all
the difference in the world, for men can only put their heart into their
work when they are inspired by a real motive.</p>
<p>By such means the new commonwealth could be built up within the
existing state and industrial system. As existing civilisation falls to
pieces it would be gradually replaced by this new social order. There
would be no real practical difficulty about this, if only people could
free themselves of all the moribund social theories, Free Trade,
principles of “sound finance,” and all the other useless lumber that
encumbers their minds; if only they could become again as little
children and see the simple truth of things unalloyed by all the
sophisticated nonsense that came into existence to bolster up the
existing system, a great part of which has been incorporated in
Socialist theory. For if they could only clear their minds of such
impedimenta and look at facts as they exist, they would see that it
would be a perfectly simple proposition to build up one society within
another if it were frankly acknowledged that at every stage in its
development the new society stood in need of protection. The foundations
of such a society would rest, as all stable societies rest, upon
agriculture, and to effect such a revival as we anticipate it would, in
the first instance, be necessary to stabilise prices of agricultural
produce by means of their fixation. Uncertainty as to price is the thing
that stands in the way of a revival of agriculture, by placing the
farmer very much at the mercy of circumstances over which he has no
control, while it is particularly demoralising to the small-holder, who
is without a sufficient reserve of capital and is too busy with the work
of actual production to be able to follow the markets closely. Moreover,
it puts them into the hands of dealers and middlemen, who absorb the
larger part of the profits of agriculture. The only remedy for this evil
is to put an end once for all to waste and speculation by the fixation
of prices based upon the cost of production and maintained by
Agricultural Guilds, which would, in addition, be centres of mutual aid,
buy and sell, and do other work undertaken by agricultural organisation
societies. They should, moreover, administer the land; and in this
connection I would suggest that the land should be owned, as well as
administered, by the local Guilds. This suggestion is offered as an
alternative to nationalisation, in order to avoid the evils of
bureaucracy. But the land question is not so urgent as the fixation of
prices, to effect which should be the immediate objective of reformers.
For until prices are fixed, not only will it be difficult to allay those
feelings of mutual suspicion that make wider co-operation so difficult,
especially among agriculturalists, but it will be impossible to plan or
arrange anything that may not be subsequently upset by fluctuations of
the market.<a href="#fn55" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref55" role="doc-noteref"><sup>55</sup></a></p>

</section>
<p>Upon this basis of agriculture, the new industries in which the
subdivision of labour was abolished and machinery controlled would rest.
Such industries would need to be protected in the early stages against
the competition of industries in which existing abuses were retained.
And the simplest way to do this would be to put a tax upon all goods
produced by means of the subdivision of labour and the use of such
machinery as conflicts with the claims of personality and art, which
taxation should increase year by year until all such industry ceased to
exist. As to where to draw the line there should be no difficulty, once
the principle were recognised that production which served quantitative
ends was degrading and that which served qualitative ends is not. Anyone
of aesthetic sensibility, with practical experience of craft production,
would know instinctively where to draw it, and the public could easily
find out if they meant business. The difficulties are really imaginary,
since, if the public were persuaded of the desirability of replacing the
quantitative standard hy a qualitative one, they would trust the
judgment of men with experience of craft production to give effect to
their wishes, as they do in other matters where expert knowledge is
required.</p>
<p>After a time, when this new society began to develop an organised
life of its own, it would no longer stand in need of protection against
the competition of outside industries, for the saving of cost that would
be effected by the elimination of cross-distribution, of overhead
charges, and of waste which would follow the resumption of the control
of industry by craftsmen and technologists, would more than compensate
for the increased cost of the actual production. Still, prices and wages
should be fixed, and every industry be under the control of Guilds to
prevent capitalism growing up again within the new society, which it
certainly would do if freedom of bargaining were permitted. There would
be no practical difficulty about reconstruction upon such lines once the
idea was properly understood. The problem is emphatically one of order.
Take issues in their natural order, and everything will straighten
itself out beautifully. All the minor details or secondary parts will
fall into their proper places. But approach these same issues in a wrong
order, and confusion results. No subsequent adjustments can remedy the
initial error. This principle is universally true. It is as true of
rebuilding society as it is of writing a book or designing a building.
The secret of success in each case will be found finally to rest upon
the perception of the order in which the various issues are taken. “They
are called wise,” says Aquinas, “who put things in their right order and
control them well.”</p>
<p>The scheme I have outlined is presented as one for the rebuilding of
society on the assumption industrial civilisation will disintegrate.
Yet, as a matter of fact, if the proposals here made were acted upon in
the near future, there would be no sudden catastrophic change, but a
gradual transition; for the proposals I have advanced might be likened
to the underpinning of a house, the foundations of which were giving
way, and which, when once done, rendered the structure stable. For the
revival of agriculture, by providing a largely increased home market for
industrial wares, would tend gradually to free industry from its
dependence upon foreign markets. Of course, we cannot dispense with
foreign trade altogether, but it cannot be denied that a condition of
affairs in which we get wheat from America, beef from the Argentine,
mutton from New Zealand, eggs from Egypt, and butter from Siberia, as we
were doing before the War, while land at home remains idle and the
unemployed are not allowed to do any useful work, is too idiotic for
words, and cannot last for long. For a nation that has allowed its
economic arrangements to drift into such a condition inevitably
experiences the fleeting nature of prosperity that is built upon foreign
trade, for it comes to be at the mercy of forces it is powerless to
control. And what is true of the production of food is true of
industrial production. It was an accidental and temporary, and not a
permanent circumstance, that gave colour to the theory, so popular in
the first half of the last century, that England was destined to become
the workshop of the world, and its unreality is nowadays being brought
home to us. The only rational society is one that is as self-contained
as possible, for only such societies can bring order into their internal
economic arrangements.</p>
<p>But it will be said: What about our population? The self-contained
national unit may be an ideal, but such an ideal is an impossible one
for a country like ours which has to support such a huge population on
such a limited area. My answer is that so far from the policy I advocate
increasing our difficulties in this direction it actually decreases
them; for is it not apparent that if we produced our own food
unemployment would be lessened, while the reaction of the revival of
agriculture upon building and other industries would be to provide
additional employment. To argue, as some Free Traders do, that because
we cannot produce all the food we require, we need not therefore trouble
to produce any, seems to me the last word in imbecility, for it is
evident that every additional acre under cultivation reduces in size the
problem that confronts us. Such imbecility comes of exalting a measure
of temporary economic expediency, such as Free Trade, into a principle
of economics. Still, in the long run it has to be admitted that we shall
not be able to support our present population. But this will not be
because we revive agriculture and the crafts, which can only increase
employment, but because one by one we are losing our foreign markets. It
is for this reason that emigration on a great scale is a necessary part
of any scheme of social reorganisation. Apart from it, the choice as
regards our surplus population must be one between actual starvation or
semi-starvation by doles; for the evidence is, so far as I can see,
conclusive that in the future the general tendency will be for
industrialism to contract rather than to expand. So, while it would be
possible by reviving agriculture and craftsmanship to find a temporary
solution for the unemployed problem, we may be assured that, apart from
organised emigration, in a few years’ time the existing problem would be
back again.</p>
<p>When, however, we advocate the need of emigration, we find ourselves
confronted by a deep-rooted prejudice in the Labour movement which is
partly well founded, but which in the main derives from the utterly
fallacious economic theories to which the movement is committed; for the
Socialist theory in the Fabian form in which the Labour movement
received it, ignores altogether the temporary and accidental
circumstances which led to our enormous industrial expansion during the
nineteenth century, and proceeds upon the assumption that industry may
expand indefinitely. And yet, while every fact in the economic situation
to-day demonstrates without a shadow of doubt that such an assumption is
entirely unfounded, the Labour movement in its general outlook continues
to act as if it were true. But the opposition of Labour to emigration is
not entirely due to prejudice. Part of it at least is based upon the
well-founded suspicion that emigration recommends itself to many
imperially minded citizens rather as a means of evading the problem of
social reconstruction than as a necessary part of a national (I should
say international) scheme. The word “emigration” is apt to stink in the
nostrils of men who, when they find themselves out of work and half
starving, are airily told that their duty is to get out of the country
as quickly as possible that they may starve elsewhere, as they certainly
would, for emigration as an isolated proposition pursued by one country
is useless, since, as the present unemployed problem is international,
apart from concerted action on the part of other countries, it follows
that, just to the extent that emigration would relieve the problem of
unemployment here, it would intensify it somewhere else.</p>
<p>But that is not the only trouble. The unintelligent and unsympathetic
attitude revealed in the recently proposed Government scheme of
emigration was, apart from any other consideration, calculated to
provoke opposition. In former times emigration was by groups.</p>
<p>When, as among the Greeks, a community came to the conclusion that it
was over-populated, emigration was undertaken by groups. Such
communities planted out new societies that consisted of groups of
families in which there were agriculturalists, craftsmen, doctors, and
others whose labour was necessary to fulfil the variety of needs that
are called into existence by a civilised life. It was in some such way
that the Pilgrim Fathers sailed out and began the colonisation of
America. They founded societies that were comparatively stable, and not
least of the things that enabled them to found such societies was that,
in spite of their Puritanism, some of the old Mediaeval communal spirit
survived among them, as it has survived among Italians and Eastern
Europeans, who emigrated in groups until emigration was brought to an
end by the War. But among Western Europeans this tradition has died out.
For some long time emigration has been largely left to individual
initiative. The result is that the man who emigrates rarely settles down
in the land of his adoption. As he is separated from his friends, he
cherishes the hope of making a pile and returning home. It is this
spirit that has corrupted colonial life, and has brought into existence
in America and the colonies in less than a century social problems as
bad, if not worse, than our own, which have taken centuries to develop.
For the entire absence in the new countries of any of the old communal
spirit has engendered a spirit of individualism much more ruthless and
intense than anything in the older countries. It has brought into
existence an atmosphere that is bad for men, but which is utterly
demoralising in the case of boys. Yet the Government have so little
sense of human psychology that, instead of proposing a scheme for the
emigration of people in groups, of families capable of co-operating
together, they actually proposed to take boys at the most impressionable
period of their lives, between the ages of fourteen and seventeen, and
tear them away from their families without proper provision for their
moral and spiritual welfare. It is true that the scheme provided that
the consent of the boy and his father had to be obtained. But, as a
matter of fact, neither are free agents. The boys, broken by lack of
work at home, have lost hope, while the parents, crushed down by
economic pressure, consent to a scheme which completes the
disintegration of the family. Is there any wonder that Labour should be
opposed to emigration when it is conceived in such a purely
matter-of-fact business-like spirit? It brings into a vivid light our
false approach to the social question, of viewing men and boys as
economic units rather than as human beings with souls to be saved. It is
this point of view that penetrates the social theory, if it does not
express the mind of reformers, that brings to naught their best
intentions.</p>
<p>Could anything better illustrate the need of giving to spiritual
values the primacy in our lives? For it is certain that until we do the
human side of life will not be respected. There will remain that
contempt of personality which not only degrades men in their work, but
which finally dissolves all those personal and human ties which are
necessary to the preservation of society in a sound and wholesome
condition. It has been said that the world, like a ship, has a wonderful
self-righting power. And that may be so when the weights are in the
right place. But if they are not, as is the case to-day, then there are
finally but two ways in which the balance may be restored. One of these
is the path of revolution, by the violent destruction of false ideas and
parasitic growths, as happened in Russia, when, after a period of
anarchy, the new order begins to emerge. The other is the way of
Christianity. It is the path of renunciation and repentance, of the
determination to live new lives and willing sacrifice of such privileges
and advantages, such comfort and convenience, as are to be got only by
the degradation and enslavement of the workers and which conflict with
the claims of a higher and nobler life. The choice before us is finally
between these alternatives, and it is a choice that can no longer be
postponed. For our civilisation becomes daily more unstable, and the end
is in sight.</p>
