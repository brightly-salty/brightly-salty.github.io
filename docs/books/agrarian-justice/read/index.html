<h1></h1>
<p>To preserve the benefits of what is called civilized life, and to
remedy, at the same time, the evil which it has produced, ought to be
considered as one of the first objects of reformed legislation.</p>
<p>Whether that state that is proudly, perhaps erroneously, called
civilization, has most promoted or most injured the general happiness of
man, is a question that may be strongly contested. On one side, the
spectator is dazzled by splendid appearances; on the other, he is
shocked by extremes of wretchedness; both of which he has erected. The
most affluent and the most miserable of the human race are to be found
in the countries that are called civilized.</p>
<p>To understand what the state of society ought to be, it is necessary
to have some idea of the natural and primitive state of man; such as it
is at this day among the Indians of North America. There is not, in that
state, any of those spectacles of human misery which poverty and want
present to our eyes, in all the towns and streets of Europe.</p>
<p>Poverty, therefore, is a thing created by that which is called
civilized life. It exists not in the natural state. On the other hand,
the natural state is without those advantages which flow from
agriculture, arts, science, and manufactures.</p>
<p>The life of an Indian is a continual holiday, compared with the poor
of Europe; and, on the other hand, it appears to be abject when compared
to the rich. Civilization, therefore, or that which is so called, has
operated two ways; to make one part of society more affluent, and the
other more wretched, than would have been the lot of either in a natural
state.</p>
<p>It is always possible to go from the natural to the civilized state,
but it is never possible to go from the civilized to the natural state.
The reason is, that man, in a natural state, subsisting by hunting,
requires ten times the quantity of land to range over, to procure
himself sustenance, than would support him in a civilized state, where
the earth is cultivated. When, therefore, a country becomes populous by
the additional aids of cultivation, arts and science, there is a
necessity of preserving things in that state; because without it, there
cannot be sustenance for more, perhaps, than a tenth part of its
inhabitants. The thing, therefore, now to be done, is, to remedy the
evils, and preserve the benefits that have arisen to society, by passing
from the natural to that which is called the civilized state.</p>
<p>In taking the matter up on this ground, the first principle of
civilization ought to have been, and ought still to be, that the
condition of every person born into the world, after a state of
civilization commences, ought not to be worse than if he had been born
before that period. But the fact is, that the condition of millions, in
every country in Europe, is far worse than if they had been born before
civilization began, or had been born among the Indians of North America
at the present day. I will show how this fact has happened.</p>
<p>It is a position not to be controverted, that the earth, in its
natural, uncultivated state, was, and ever would have continued to be,
<em>the common property of the human race</em>. In that state every man
would have been born to property. He would have been a joint
life-proprietor with the rest in the property of the soil, and in all
its natural productions, vegetable and animal.</p>
<p>But the earth, in its natural state, as before said, is capable of
supporting but a small number of inhabitants compared with what it is
capable of doing in a cultivated state. And as it is impossible to
separate the improvement made by cultivation, from the earth itself,
upon which that improvement is made, the idea of landed property arose
from that inseparable connexion; but it is nevertheless true, that it is
the value of the improvement only, and not the earth itself, that is
individual property. Every proprietor therefore, of cultivated land,
owes to the community, a <em>ground-rent</em>; for I know of no better
term to express the idea by, for the land which he holds: and it is from
this ground-rent that the fund proposed in this plan is to issue.</p>
<p>It is deducible, as well from the nature of the thing, as from all
the histories transmitted to us, that the idea of landed property
commenced with cultivation, and that there was no such thing as landed
property before that time. It could not exist in the first state of man,
that of hunters. It did not exist in the second state, that of
shepherds: neither Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, nor Job, so far as the history
of the Bible may be credited in probable things, were owners of land.
Their property consisted, as is always enumerated, in flocks and herds,
and they travelled with them from place to place. The frequent
contentions, at that time, about the use of a well in the dry country of
Arabia, where those people lived, show also that there was no landed
property. It was not admitted that land could be claimed as
property.</p>
<p>There could be no such thing as landed property originally. Man did
not make the earth, and, though he had a natural right to
<em>occupy</em> it, he had no right to <em>locate</em> as his
<em>property</em> in perpetuity any part of it: neither did the Creator
of the earth open a land-office, from whence the first title-deeds
should issue. Whence, then, arose the idea of landed property? I answer
as before, that when cultivation began, the idea of landed property
began with it, from the impossibility of separating the improvement made
by cultivation from the earth itself, upon which that improvement was
made. The value of the improvement so far exceeded the value of the
natural earth, at that time, as to absorb it; till, in the end, the
common right of all became confounded into the cultivated right of the
individual. But they are, nevertheless, distinct species of rights, and
will continue to be so long as the earth endures.</p>
<p>It is only by tracing things to their origin that we can gain
rightful ideas of them, and it is by gaining such ideas that we discover
the boundary that divides right from wrong, and which teaches every man
to know his own. I have entitled this tract Agrarian Justice, to
distinguish it from Agrarian Law. Nothing could be more unjust than
Agrarian Law in a country improved by cultivation; for though every man,
as an inhabitant of the earth, is a joint proprietor of it in its
natural state, it does not follow that he is a joint proprietor of
cultivated earth. The additional value made by cultivation, after the
system was admitted, became the property of those who did it, or who
inherited it from them, or who purchased it. It had originally no owner.
Whilst, therefore, I advocate the right, and interest myself in the hard
case of all those who have been thrown out of their natural inheritance
by the introduction of the system of landed property, I equally defend
the right of the possessor to the part which is his.</p>
<p>Cultivation is, at least, one of the greatest natural improvements
ever made by human invention. It has given to created earth a tenfold
value. But the landed monopoly that began with it, has produced the
greatest evil. It has dispossessed more than half the inhabitants of
every nation of their natural inheritance, without providing for them,
as ought to have been done, an indemnification for that loss, and has
thereby created a species of poverty and wretchedness that did not exist
before.</p>
<p>In advocating the case of the persons thus dispossessed, it is a
right and not a charity that I am pleading for. But it is that kind of
right, which, being neglected at first, could not be brought forward
afterwards, till heaven had opened the way by a revolution in the system
of government. Let us then do honour to revolutions by justice, and give
currency to their principles by blessings.</p>
<p>Having thus, in a few words, opened the merits of the ease, I shall
now proceed to the plan I have to propose, which is,</p>
<p>To create a national fund, out of which there shall be paid to every
person, when arrived at the age of twenty-one years, the sum of fifteen
pounds sterling, as a compensation in part, for the loss of his or her
natural inheritance, by the introduction of the system of landed
property.</p>
<p>And also, the sum of ten pounds per annum, during life, to every
person now living, of the age of fifty years, and to all others as they
shall arrive at that age.</p>
<section id="means-by-which-the-fund-is-to-be-created" class="level2">
<h2>Means by which the fund is to be created</h2>
<p>I have already established the principle, namely, that the earth, in
its natural, uncultivated state, was, and ever would have continued to
be, the <em>common property of the human race</em>; that in that state,
every person would have been born to property; and that the system of
landed property, by its inseparable connexion with cultivation, and with
what is called civilized life, has absorbed the property of all those
whom it dispossessed, without providing, as ought to have been done, an
indemnification for that loss.</p>
<p>The fault, however, is not in the present possessors.—No complaint is
intended, or ought to be alleged against them, unless they adopt the
crime by opposing justice. The fault is in the system, and it has stolen
imperceptibly upon the world, aided afterwards by the Agrarian law of
the sword. But the fault can be made to reform itself by successive
generations, without diminishing or deranging the property of any of the
present possessors, and yet the operation of the fund can commence, and
be in full activity, the first year of its establishment, or soon after,
as I shall show.</p>
<p>It is proposed that the payments, as already stated, be made to every
person, rich or poor. It is best to make it so, to prevent invidious
distinctions. It is also right it should be so, because it is in lieu of
the natural inheritance, which, as a right, belongs to every man. over
and above the property he may have created or inherited from those who
did. Such persons as do not choose to receive it, can throw it into the
common fund.</p>
<p>Taking it then for granted, that no person ought to be in a worse
condition when born under what is called a state of civilization, than
he would have been, had he been born in a state of nature, and that
civilization ought to have made, and ought still to make, provision for
that purpose, it can only be done by subtracting from property, a
portion equal in value to the natural inheritance it has absorbed.</p>
<p>Various methods may be proposed for this purpose, but that which
appears to be the best, not only because it will operate without
deranging any present possessors, or without interfering with the
collection of taxes, or <em>emprunts</em> necessary for the purposes of
government and the revolution, but because it will be the least
troublesome and the most effectual, and also because the subtraction
will be made at a time that best admits it, which is, at the moment that
property is passing by the death of one person to the possession of
another. In this case, the bequeather gives nothing; the receiver pays
nothing. The only matter to him is, that the monopoly of natural
inheritance, to which there never was a right, begins to cease in his
person. A generous man would not wish it to continue, and a just man
will rejoice to see it abolished.</p>
<p>My state of health prevents my making sufficient inquiries with
respect to the doctrine of probabilities, whereon to found calculations
with such degrees of certainty as they are capable of. What, therefore,
I offer on this head is more the result of observation and reflection,
than of received information; but I believe it will be found to agree
sufficiently enough with fact.</p>
<p>In the first place, taking twenty-one years as the epoch of maturity,
all the property of a nation, real and personal, is always in the
possession of persons above that age. It is then necessary to know as a
datum of calculation, the average of years which persons above that age
will live. I take this average to be about thirty years, for though many
persons will live forty, fifty, or sixty years after the age of
twenty-one years, others will die much sooner, and some in every year of
that time.</p>
<p>Taking, then, thirty years as the average of time, it will give,
without any material variation, one way or other, the average of time in
which the whole property or capital of a nation, or a sum equal thereto,
will have passed through one entire revolution in descent, that is, will
have gone by deaths to new possessors; for though, in many instances,
some parts of this capital will remain forty, fifty, or sixty years in
the possession of one person, other parts will have revolved two or
three times before those thirty years expire, which will bring it to
that average; for were one half the capital of a nation to revolve twice
in thirty years, it would produce the same fund as if the whole revolved
once.</p>
<p>Taking, then, thirty years as the average of time in which the whole
capital of a nation, or a sum equal thereto, will revolve once, the
thirtieth part thereof will be the sum that will revolve every year,
that is, will go by deaths to new possessors; and this last sum being
thus known, and the ratio percent, to be subtracted from it being
determined, will give the annual amount or income of the proposed fund,
to be applied as already mentioned.</p>
<p>In looking over the discourse of the English minister, Pitt, in his
opening of what is called in England, the budget, (the scheme of finance
for the year 1796,) I find an estimate of the national capital of that
country. As this estimate of a national capital is prepared ready to my
hand, I take it as a datum to act upon. When a calculation is made upon
the known capital of any nation, combined with its population, it will
serve as a scale for any other nation, in proportion as its capital and
population be more or less. I am the more disposed to take this estimate
of Mr. Pitt, for the purpose of showing to that minister, upon his own
calculation, how much better money may be employed, than in wasting it,
as he has done, on the wild project of setting up Bourbon kings. What,
in the name of heaven, are Bourbon kings to the people of England? It is
better that the people have bread.</p>
<p>Mr. Pitt states the national capital of England, real and personal,
to be one thousand three hundred millions sterling, which is about
one-fourth part of the national capital of France, including Belgium.
The event of the last harvest in each country proves that the soil of
France is more productive than that of England, and that it can better
support twenty-four or twenty-five millions of inhabitants than that of
England can seven, or seven and an half.</p>
<p>The thirtieth part of this capital of 1,300,000,000<em>l</em>. is
43,333,333<em>l</em>. which is the part that will revolve every year by
deaths in that country to new possessors; and the sum that will annually
revolve in France in the proportion of four to one, will be about one
hundred and seventy-three millions sterling. From this sum of
43,333,333<em>l</em>. annually revolving, is to be subtracted the value
of the natural inheritance absorbed in it, which perhaps, in fair
justice, cannot be taken at less, and ought not to be taken for more,
than a tenth part.</p>
<p>It will always happen, that of the property thus revolving by deaths
every year, part will descend in a direct line to sons and daughters,
and the other part collaterally, and the proportion will be found to be
about three to one; that is, about thirty millions of the above sum will
descend to direct heirs, and the remaining sum of 13,333.333<em>l</em>.
to more distant relations, and part to strangers.</p>
<p>Considering, then, that man is always related to society, that
relationship will become comparatively greater in proportion as the next
of kin is more distant, it is therefore consistent with civilization to
say, that where there are no direct heirs, society shall be heir to a
part over and above the tenth part <em>due</em> to society. If this
additional part be from 5-10 or 12%, in proportion as the next of kin be
nearer or more remote, so as to average with the escheats that may fall,
which ought always to go to society and not to the government, an
addition of 10%, more; the produce from the annual sum of
43,333,333<em>l</em>. will be,</p>

</table>
<p>Having thus arrived at the annual amount of the proposed fund, I
come, in the next place, to speak of the population proportioned to this
fund, and to compare it with the uses to which the fund is to be
applied.</p>
<p>The population (I mean that of England) does not exceed seven
millions and an half, and the number of persons above the age of fifty
will in that case be about four hundred thousand. There would not,
however, be more than that number that would accept the proposed ten
pounds sterling per annum, though they would be entitled to it. I have
no idea it would be accepted by many persons who had a yearly income of
two or three hundred pounds sterling. But as we often see instances of
rich people falling into sudden poverty, even at the age of sixty, they
would always have the right of drawing all the arrears due to them. Four
millions, therefore, of the above annual sum of 5,666,666<em>l</em>.
will be required for four hundred thousand aged persons, at ten pounds
sterling each.</p>
<p>I come now to speak of the persons annually arriving at twenty-one
years of age. If all the persons who died were above the age of
twenty-one years, the number of persons annually arriving at that age,
must be equal to the annual number of deaths, to keep the population
stationary. But the greater part die under the age of twenty-one, and
therefore the number of persons annually arriving at twenty-one, will be
less than half the number of deaths. The whole number of deaths upon a
population of seven millions and an half, will be about 220,000
annually. The number arriving at twenty-one years of age will be about
100,000. The whole number of these will not receive the proposed fifteen
pounds, for the reasons already mentioned, though, as in the former
case, they would be entitled to it. Admitting then that a tenth part
declined receiving it, the amount would stand thus:</p>
<p>Fund annually: 5,666,666<em>l</em>.</p>
<p>To 400,000 aged persons at 10<em>l</em>. each:
4,000,000<em>l</em>.</p>
<p>To 90,000 persons of 21 years, 15<em>l</em>. ster. ea.: 1,350,000</p>
<p>5,350,000; remains 316,666<em>l</em>.</p>
<p>There are in every country a number of blind and lame persons,
totally incapable of earning a livelihood. But as it will always happen
that the greater number of blind persons will be among those who are
above the age of fifty years, they will be provided for in that class.
The remaining sum of 316,666<em>l</em>. will provide for the lame and
blind under that age, at the same rate of 10<em>l</em>. annually for
each person.</p>
<p>Having now gone through all the necessary calculations, and stated
the particulars of the plan, 1 shall conclude with some
observations.</p>
<p>It is not charity but a right; not bounty but justice, that I am
pleading for. The contrast of affluence and wretchedness continually
meeting and offending the rye, is like dead and living bodies chained
together. Though I care as little about riches as any man, I am a friend
to riches because they are capable of good. I care not how affluent some
may be, provided that none be miserable in consequence of it. But it is
impossible to enjoy affluence with the felicity it is capable of being
enjoyed, whilst so much misery is mingled in the scene. The sight of the
misery, and the unpleasant sensations it suggests, which, though they
may be suffocated, cannot be extinguished, are a greater drawback upon
the felicity of affluence than the proposed 10%, upon property is worth.
He that would not give the one to get rid of the other, has no charity,
even for himself.</p>
<p>There are, in every country, some magnificent charities established
by individuals. It is, however, but little that any individual can do,
when the whole extent of the misery to be relieved is considered. He may
satisfy his conscience, but not his heart. He may give all that he has,
and that all will relieve but little. It is only by organizing
civilization upon such principles as to act like a system of pullies,
that the whole weight of misery can be removed.</p>
<p>The plan here proposed will reach the whole. It will immediately
relieve and take out of view three classes of wretchedness. The blind,
the lame, and the aged poor; and it will furnish the rising generation
with means to prevent their becoming poor; and it will do this, without
deranging or interfering with any national measures. To show that this
will be the case, it is sufficient to observe, that the operation and
effect of the plan will, in all cases, be the same, as if every
individual were <em>voluntarily</em> to make his will, and dispose of
his property, in the manner here proposed.</p>
<p>But it is justice and not charity, that is the principle of the plan.
In all great cases it is necessary to have a principle more universally
active than charity; and with respect to justice, it ought not to be
left to the choice of detached individuals, whether they will do justice
or not.—Considering, then, the plan on the ground of justice, it ought
to be the act of the whole, growing spontaneously out of the principles
of the revolution, and the reputation of it ought to be national and not
individual.</p>
<p>A plan upon this principle would benefit the revolution, by the
energy that springs from the consciousness of justice. It would multiply
also the national resources; for property, like vegetation, increases by
offsets. When a young couple begin the world, the difference is
exceedingly great, whether they begin with nothing or with fifteen
pounds apiece. With this aid they could buy a cow, and implements to
cultivate a few acres of land; and instead of becoming burdens upon
society, which is always the case, where children are produced faster
than they can be fed, would be put in the way of becoming useful and
profitable citizens. The national domains also would sell the better if
pecuniary aids were provided to cultivate them in small lots.</p>
<p>It is the practice of what has unjustly obtained the name of
civilization (and the practice merits not to be called either charity or
policy) to make some provision for persons becoming poor and wretched,
only at the time they become so. Would it not, even as a matter of
economy, be far better, to devise means to prevent their becoming poor.
This can best be done, by making every person, when arrived at the age
of twenty-one years, an inheritor of something to begin with. The rugged
face of society, chequered with the extremes of affluence and of want,
proves that some extraordinary violence has been committed upon it, and
calls on justice for redress. The great mass of the poor, in all
countries, are become an hereditary race, and it is next to impossible
for them to get out of that state of themselves. It ought also to be
observed, that this mass increases in all countries that are called
civilized. More persons fall annually into it, than get out of it.</p>
<p>Though in a plan, in which justice and humanity are the
foundation-principles, interest ought not to be admitted into the
calculation, yet it is always of advantage to the establishment of any
plan, to show that it is beneficial as a matter of interest. The success
of any proposed plan submitted to public consideration, must finally
depend on the numbers interested in supporting it, united with the
justice of its principles.</p>
<p>The plan here proposed will benefit all, without injuring any. It
will consolidate the interest of the republic with that of the
individual. To the numerous class dispossessed of their natural
inheritance by the system of landed property, it will be an act of
national justice. To persons dying possessed of moderate fortunes, it
will operate as a tontine to their children, more beneficial than the
sum of money paid into the fund: and it will give to the accumulation of
riches a degree of security, that none of the old governments of Europe,
now tottering on their foundations, can give.</p>
<p>I do not suppose that more than one family in ten, in any of the
countries of Europe, has, when the head of the family dies, a clear
property left of five hundred pounds sterling. To all such, the plan is
advantageous. That property would pay fifty pounds into the fund, and if
there were only two’ children under age, they would receive fifteen
pounds each, (thirty pounds) on coming of age, and be entitled to ten
pounds a year after fifty. It is from the overgrown acquisition of
property that the fund will support itself; and I know that the
possessors of such property in England, though they would eventually be
benefited by the protection of nine-tenths of it, will exclaim against
the plan. But, without entering into any inquiry how they came by that
property, let them recollect that they have been the advocates of this
war, and that Mr. Pitt has already laid on more new taxes to be raised
annually upon the people of England, and that for supporting the
despotism of Austria and the Bourbons, against the liberties of France,
than would pay annually all the sums proposed in this plan.</p>
<p>I have made the calculations, stated in this plan, upon what is
called personal, as well as upon landed property. The reason for making
it upon land is already explained; and the reason for taking personal
property into the calculation, is equally well founded, though on a
different principle. Land, as before said, is the free gift of the
Creator in common to the human race. Personal property is the <em>effect
of society</em>; and it is as impossible for an individual to acquire
personal property without the aid of society, as it is for him to make
land originally. Separate an individual from society, and give him an
island or a continent to possess, and he cannot acquire personal
property. He cannot become rich. So inseparably are the means connected
with the end, in all cases, that where the former do not exist, the
latter cannot be obtained. All accumulation, therefore, of personal
property, beyond what a man’s own hands produce, is derived to him by
living in society; and he owes, on every principle of justice, of
gratitude, and of civilization, a part of that accumulation back again
to society from whence the whole came. This is putting the matter on a
general principle, and perhaps it is best to do so; for if we examine
the case minutely, it will be found, that the accumulation of personal
property is, in many instances, the effect of paying too little for the
labour that produced it; the consequence of which is, that the working
hand perishes in old age, and the employer abounds in affluence. It is,
perhaps, impossible to proportion exactly the price of labour to the
profits it produces; and it will also be said, as an apology for the
injustice, that were a workman to receive an increase of wages daily, he
would not save it against old age, nor be much better for it in the
interim. Make, then, society the treasurer, to guard it for him in a
common fund; for it is no reason, that because he might not make a good
use of it for himself, that another should take it.</p>
<p>The state of civilization that has prevailed throughout Europe, is as
unjust in its principle, as it is horrid in its effects; and it is the
consciousness of this, and the apprehension that such a state cannot
continue, when once investigation begins in any country, that makes the
possessors of property dread every idea of a revolution. It is the
hazard and not the principles of a revolution that retards their
progress. This being the case, it is necessary as well for the
protection of property, as for the sake of justice and humanity, to form
a system, that whilst it preserves one part of society from
wretchedness, shall secure the other from depredation.</p>
<p>The superstitious awe, the enslaving reverence, that formerly
surrounded affluence, is passing away in all countries, and leaving the
possessor of property to the convulsion of accidents. When wealth and
splendour, instead of fascinating the multitude, excite emotions of
disgust; when, instead of drawing forth admiration, it is beheld as an
insult upon wretchedness; when the ostentatious appearance it makes,
serves to call the right of it in question, the case of property becomes
critical, and it is only in a system of justice that the possessor can
contemplate security.</p>
<p>To remove the danger, it is necessary to remove the antipathies, and
this can only be done by making property productive of a national
blessing, extending to every individual. When the riches of one man
above another shall increase the national fund in the same proportion;
when it shall be seen that the prosperity of that fund depends on the
prosperity of individuals; when the more riches a man. acquires, the
better it shall be for the general mass; it is then that antipathies
will cease, and property be placed on the permanent basis of national
interest and protection.</p>
<p>I have no property in France to become subject to the plan 1 propose.
What I have, which is not much, is in the United States of America. But
I will pay one hundred pounds sterling towards this fund in France, the
instant it shall be established; and I will pay the same sum in England,
whenever a similar establishment shall take place in that country.</p>
<p>A revolution in the state of civilization, is the necessary companion
of revolutions in the system of government. If a revolution in any
country be from bad to good, or from good to bad, the state of what is
called civilization in that country, must be made conformable thereto,
to give that revolution effect. Despotic government supports itself by
abject civilization, in which debasement of the human mind, and
wretchedness in the mass of the people, are the chief criterions. Such
governments consider man merely as an animal; that the exercise of
intellectual faculty is not his privilege; <em>that he has nothing to do
with the laws, but to obey them;</em>and they politically depend more
upon breaking the spirit of the people by poverty, than they fear
enraging it by desperation.</p>
<p>It is a revolution in the state of civilization, that will give
perfection to the revolution of France. Already the conviction that
government, by representation, is the true system of government, is
spreading itself fast in the world. The reasonableness of it can be seen
by all. The justness of it makes itself felt even by its opposers. But
when a system of civilization, growing out of that system of government,
shall be so organized, that not a man or woman born in the republic, but
shall inherit some means of beginning the world, and see before them the
certainty of escaping the miseries that under other governments
accompany old age, the revolution of France will have an advocate and an
ally in the hearts of all nations.</p>
<p>An army of principles will penetrate where an army of soldiers
cannot; it will succeed where diplomatic management would fail; it is
neither the Rhine, the Channel, nor the Ocean, that can arrest its
progress; it will march on the horizon of the world, and it will
conquer.</p>

<h2>Means for carrying the proposed plan into execution, and to render
it at the same time conducive to the public interest</h2>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Each canton shall elect in its primary assemblies, three persons,
as commissioners for that canton, who shall take cognizance, and keep a
register of all matters happening in that canton, conformable to the
charter that shall be established by law, for carrying this plan into
execution.</p></li>
<li><p>The law shall fix the manner in which the property of deceased
persons shall be ascertained.</p></li>
<li><p>When the amount of the property of any deceased person shall be
ascertained, the principal heir to that property, or the eldest of the
co-heirs, if of lawful age, or if under age, the person authorized by
the will of the deceased to represent him or them, shall give bond to
the commissioners of the canton, to pay the said tenth part thereof
within the space of one year, in four equal quarterly payments, or
sooner, at the choice of the payers. One half of the whole property
shall remain as security until the bond be paid off.</p></li>
<li><p>The bond shall be registered in the office of the commissioners
of the canton, and the original bonds shall be deposited in the national
bank at Paris. The bank shall publish every quarter of a year the amount
of the bonds in its possession, and also the bonds that shall have been
paid off, or what parts thereof, since the last quarterly
publication.</p></li>
<li><p>The national bank shall issue bank notes upon the security of the
bonds in its possession. The notes so issued, shall be applied to pay
the pensions of aged persons, and the compensations to persons arriving
at twenty-one years of age. It is both reasonable and generous to
suppose, that persons not under immediate necessity, will suspend their
right of drawing on the fund, until it acquire, as it will do. a greater
degree of ability. In this case, it is proposed, than an honorary
register be kept in each canton, of the names of the persons thus
suspending that right, at least during the present war.</p></li>
<li><p>As the inheritors of property must always take up their bonds in
four quarterly payments, or sooner if they choose, there will always be
numeraire arriving at the bank after the expiration of the first
quarter, to exchange for the bank notes that shall be brought
in.</p></li>
<li><p>The bank notes being thus put in circulation, upon the best of
all possible security, that of actual property, to more than four times
the amount of the bonds upon which the notes are issued, and with
<em>numeraire</em> continually arriving at the bank to exchange or pay
them off whenever they shall be presented for that purpose, they will
acquire a permanent value in all parts of the republic. They can
therefore be received in payment of taxes or <em>emprunts</em> equal to
<em>numeraire</em>, because the government can always receive
<em>numeraire</em> for them at the bank.</p></li>
<li><p>It will be necessary that the payments of the 10%, be made in
numeraire, for the first year, from the establishment of the plan. But
after the expiration of the first year, the inheritors of property may
pay ten percent, either in bank notes issued upon the fund, or in
<em>numeraire</em>. If the payments be in <em>numeraire</em>, it will
lie as a deposit at the bank, to be exchanged for a quantity of notes
equal to that amount; and if in notes issued upon the fund, it will
cause a demand upon the fund equal thereto; and thus the operation of
the plan will create means to carry itself into execution.</p></li>
