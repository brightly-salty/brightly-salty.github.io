<h1>Introductory</h1>
<p>It is a commonplace that the characteristic virtue of Englishmen is
their power of sustained practical activity, and their characteristic
vice a reluctance to test the quality of that activity by reference to
principles. They are incurious as to theory, take fundamentals for
granted, and are more interested in the state of the roads than in their
place on the map. And it might fairly be argued that in ordinary times
that combination of intellectual tameness with practical energy is
sufficiently serviceable to explain, if not to justify, the equanimity
with which its possessors bear the criticism of more mentally
adventurous nations. It is the mood of those who have made their bargain
with fate and are content to take what it offers without re-opening the
deal. It leaves the mind free to concentrate undisturbed upon profitable
activities, because it is not distracted by a taste for unprofitable
speculations. Most generations, it might be said, walk in a path, which
they neither make, nor discover, but accept; the main thing is that they
should march. The blinkers worn by Englishmen enable them to trot all
the more steadily along the beaten road, without being disturbed by
curiosity as to their destination.</p>
<p>But if the medicine of the constitution ought not to be made its
daily food, neither can its daily food be made medicine. There are times
which are not ordinary, and in such times it is not enough to follow the
road. It is necessary to know where it leads, and, if it leads nowhere,
to follow another. The search for another involves reflection, which is
uncongenial to the bustling people who describe themselves as practical,
because they take things as they are and leave them as they are. But the
practical thing for a traveller who is uncertain of his path is not to
proceed with the utmost rapidity in the wrong direction: it is to
consider how to find the right one. And the practical thing for a nation
which has stumbled upon one of the turning points of history is not to
behave as though nothing very important were involved, as if it did not
matter whether it turned to the right or to the left, went up hill or
down dale, provided that it continued doing with a little more energy
what it has done hitherto; but to consider whether what it has done
hitherto is wise, and, if it is not wise, to alter it.</p>
<p>When the broken ends of its industry, its politics, its social
organization, have to be pieced together after a catastrophe, it must
make a decision; for it makes a decision even if it refuses to decide.
If it is to make a decision which will wear, it must travel beyond the
philosophy momentarily in favour with the proprietors of its newspapers.
Unless it is to move with the energetic futility of a squirrel in a
revolving cage, it must have a clear apprehension both of the deficiency
of what is, and of the character of what ought to be. And to obtain this
apprehension it must appeal to some standard more stable than the
momentary exigencies of its commerce or industry or social life, and
judge them by it. It must, in short, have recourse to Principles.</p>
<p>Such considerations are, perhaps, not altogether irrelevant at a time
when facts have forced upon Englishmen the reconsideration of their
social institutions which no appeal to theory could induce them to
undertake. An appeal to principles is the condition of any considerable
reconstruction of society, because social institutions are the visible
expression of the scale of moral values which rules the minds of
individuals, and it is impossible to alter institutions without altering
that valuation. Parliament, industrial organizations, the whole complex
machinery through which society expresses itself, is a mill which grinds
only what is put into it. When nothing is put into it, it grinds
air.</p>
<p>There are many, of course, who desire no alteration, and who, when it
is attempted, will oppose it. They have found the existing economic
order profitable in the past. They desire only such changes as will
insure that it is equally profitable in the future. <em>Quand le Roi
avait bu, la Pologne était ivre.</em> They are genuinely unable to
understand why their countrymen cannot bask contentedly by the fire
which warms themselves, and ask, like the French farmer-general:—“When
everything goes so happily, why trouble to change it?” Such persons are
to be pitied, for they lack the social quality which is proper to man.
But they do not need argument; for Heaven has denied them one of the
faculties required to apprehend it.</p>
<p>There are others, however, who are conscious of the desire for a new
social order, but who yet do not grasp the implications of their own
desire. Men may genuinely sympathize with the demand for a radical
change. They may be conscious of social evils and sincerely anxious to
remove them. They may set up a new department, and appoint new
officials, and invent a new name to express their resolution to effect
something more drastic than reform, and less disturbing than revolution.
But unless they will take the pains, not only to act, but to reflect,
they end by effecting nothing. For they deliver themselves bound to
those who think they are practical, because they take their philosophy
so much for granted as to be unconscious of its implications. As soon as
they try to act, that philosophy re-asserts itself, and serves as an
overruling force which presses their action more deeply into the old
channels.</p>
<p>“Unhappy man that I am; who shall deliver me from the body of this
death?” When they desire to place their economic life on a better
foundation, they repeat, like parrots, the word “Productivity,” because
that is the word that rises first in their minds; regardless of the fact
that productivity is the foundation on which it is based already, that
increased productivity is the one characteristic achievement of the age
before the war, as religion was of the Middle Ages or art of classical
Athens, and that it is precisely in the century which has seen the
greatest increase in productivity since the fall of the Roman Empire
that economic discontent has been most acute. When they are touched by
social compunction, they can think of nothing more original than the
diminution of poverty, because poverty, being the opposite of the riches
which they value most, seems to them the most terrible of human
afflictions. They do not understand that poverty is a symptom and a
consequence of social disorder, while the disorder itself is something
at once more fundamental and more incorrigible, and that the quality in
their social life which causes it to demoralize a few by excessive
riches, is also the quality which causes it to demoralize many by
excessive poverty.</p>
<p>“But increased production is important.” Of course it is! That plenty
is good and scarcity evil—it needs no ghost from the graves of the past
seven years to tell us that. But plenty depends upon cooperative effort,
and co-operation upon moral principles. And moral principles are what
the prophets of this dispensation despise. So the world “continues in
scarcity,” because it is too grasping and too short-sighted to seek that
“which maketh men to be of one mind in a house.” The well-intentioned
schemes for social reorganization put forward by its commercial teachers
are abortive, because they endeavour to combine incompatibles, and, if
they disturb everything, they settle nothing. They are like a man who,
when he finds that his shoddy boots wear badly, orders a pair two sizes
larger instead of a pair of good leather, or who makes up for putting a
bad sixpence in the plate one Sunday by putting in a bad shilling next.
And when their fit of feverish energy has spent itself, and there is
nothing to show for it except disillusionment, they cry that reform is
impracticable, and blame human nature, when what they ought to blame is
themselves.</p>
<p>Yet all the time the principles upon which industry should be based
are simple, however difficult it may be to apply them; and if they are
overlooked it is not because they are difficult, but because they are
elementary. They are simple because industry is simple. An industry,
when all is said, is, in its essence, nothing more mysterious than a
body of men associated, in various degrees of competition and
co-operation, to win their livelihood by providing the community with
some service which it requires. Organize it as you will, let it be a
group of craftsmen labouring with hammer and chisel, or peasants
ploughing their own fields, or armies of mechanics of a hundred
different trades constructing ships which are miracles of complexity
with machines which are the climax of centuries of invention, its
function is service, its method is association. Because its function is
service, an industry as a whole has rights and duties towards the
community, the abrogation of which involves privilege. Because its
method is association, the different parties within it have rights and
duties towards each other; and the neglect or perversion of these
involves oppression.</p>
<p>The conditions of a right organization of industry are, therefore,
permanent, unchanging, and capable of being apprehended by the most
elementary intelligence, provided it will read the nature of its
countrymen in the large outlines of history, not in the bloodless
abstractions of experts. And they are the same, in all essentials, for a
society which is poor as for a society which is rich. The latter may
afford luxuries which the former must forego; the former may labour hard
on a stony soil while the latter dwells at ease in its material Zion.
These differences of economic endowment decide what industry will yield;
they do not alter the ends at which it should aim, or the moral standard
by which its organization should be tried. As long as men are men, a
poor society cannot be too poor to find a right order of life, nor a
rich society too rich to have need to seek it. And if the economists are
correct, as they may be, in warning us that the amazing outburst of
riches which took place in the nineteenth century is an episode which is
over; if the period of increasing returns has ended and the period of
diminishing returns has begun; if in the future it will be only by an
increased effort that the industrial civilization of Western Europe can
purchase from America and the tropics the foodstuffs and raw materials
which it requires, then it is all the more necessary that the principles
on which its economic order is founded should justify themselves to the
consciences of decent men.</p>
<p>The first principle is that industry should be subordinated to the
community in such a way as to render the best service technically
possible, that those who render that service faithfully should be
honourably paid, and that those who render no service should not be paid
at all, because it is of the essence of a function that it should find
its meaning in the satisfaction, not of itself, but of the end which it
serves. The second is that its direction and government should be in the
hands of persons who are responsible to those who are directed and
governed, because it is the condition of economic freedom that men
should not be ruled by an authority which they cannot control. The
industrial problem, in fact, is a problem of right, not merely of
material misery, and because it is a problem of right it is most acute
among those sections of the working classes whose material misery is
least. It is a question, first of Function, and secondly of Freedom.</p>
</section>
<section id="rights-and-functions" class="level1">
<h1>Rights and Functions</h1>
<p>A function may be defined as an activity which embodies and expresses
the idea of social purpose. The essence of it is that the agent does not
perform it merely for personal gain or to gratify himself, but
recognizes that he is responsible for its discharge to some higher
authority. The purpose of industry is obvious. It is to supply man with
things which are necessary, useful, or beautiful, and thus to bring life
to body or spirit. In so far as it is governed by this end, it is among
the most important of human activities. In so far as it is diverted from
it, it may be harmless, amusing, or even exhilarating to those who carry
it on; but it possesses no more social significance than the orderly
business of ants and bees, the strutting of peacocks, or the struggles
of carnivorous animals over carrion.</p>
<p>Men have normally appreciated this fact, however unwilling or unable
they may have been to act upon it; and therefore from time to time, in
so far as they have been able to control the forces of violence and
greed, they have adopted various expedients for emphasizing the social
quality of economic activity. It is not easy, however, to emphasize it
effectively, because to do so requires a constant effort of will,
against which egotistical instincts are in rebellion, and because, if
that will is to prevail, it must be embodied in some social and
political organization, which may itself become so arbitrary, tyrannical
and corrupt as to thwart the performance of function instead of
promoting it. When this process of degeneration has gone far, as in most
European countries it had by the middle of the eighteenth century, the
indispensable thing is to break the dead organization up and to clear
the ground. In the course of doing so, the individual is emancipated and
his rights are enlarged; but the idea of social purpose is discredited
by the discredit justly attaching to the obsolete order in which it is
embodied.</p>
<p>It is not surprising, therefore, that in the new industrial societies
which arose on the ruins of the old regime the dominant note should have
been the insistence upon individual rights, irrespective of any social
purpose to which their exercise contributed. The economic expansion
which concentrated population on the coal-measures was, in essence, an
immense movement of colonization drifting from the south and east to the
north and west; and it was natural that in those regions of England, as
in the American settlements, the characteristic philosophy should be
that of the pioneer and the mining camp. The change of social quality
was profound. But in England, at least, it was gradual, and the
“industrial revolution,” though catastrophic in its effects, was only
the visible climax of generations of subtle moral change.</p>
<p>The rise of modern economic relations, which may be dated in England
from the latter half of the seventeenth century, was coincident with the
growth of a political theory which replaced the conception of purpose by
that of mechanism. During a great part of history men had found the
significance of their social order in its relation to the universal
purposes of religion. It stood as one rung in a ladder which stretched
from hell to Paradise, and the classes who composed it were the hands,
the feet, the head of a corporate body which was itself a microcosm
imperfectly reflecting a larger universe. When the Reformation made the
Church a department of the secular government, it undermined the already
enfeebled spiritual forces which had erected that sublime, if too much
elaborated, synthesis. But its influence remained for nearly a century
after the roots which fed it had been severed. It was the atmosphere
into which men were born, and from which, however practical, or even
Machiavellian, they could not easily disengage their spirits.</p>
<p>Nor was it inconvenient for the new statecraft to see the weight of a
traditional religious sanction added to its own concern in the
subordination of all classes and interests to the common end, of which
it conceived itself, and during the greater part of the sixteenth
century was commonly conceived, to be the guardian. The lines of the
social structure were no longer supposed to reproduce in miniature the
plan of a universal order. But common habits, common traditions and
beliefs, common pressure from above gave them a unity of direction,
which restrained the forces of individual variation and lateral
expansion; and the centre towards which they converged, formerly a
Church possessing some of the characteristics of a State, was now a
State that had clothed itself with many of the attributes of a
Church.</p>
<p>The difference between the England of Shakespeare, still visited by
the ghosts of the Middle Ages, and the England which emerged in 1700
from the fierce polemics of the last two generations, was a difference
of social and political theory even more than of constitutional and
political arrangements. Not only the facts, but the minds which
appraised them, were profoundly modified. The essence of the change was
the disappearance of the idea that social institutions and economic
activities were related to common ends, which gave them their
significance and which served as their criterion.</p>
<p>In the eighteenth century both the State and the Church had abdicated
that part of their sphere which had consisted in the maintenance of a
common body of social ethics; what was left of it was the repression of
a class, not the discipline of a nation. Opinion ceased to regard social
institutions and economic activity as amenable, like personal conduct,
to moral criteria, because it was no longer influenced by the spectacle
of institutions which, arbitrary, capricious, and often corrupt in their
practical operation, had been the outward symbol and expression of the
subordination of life to purposes transcending private interests. That
part of government which had been concerned with social administration,
if it did not end, became at least obsolescent. For such democracy as
had existed in the Middle Ages was dead, and the democracy of the
Revolution was not yet born, so that government passed into the
lethargic hand of classes who wielded the power of the State in the
interests of an irresponsible aristocracy.</p>
<p>And the Church was even more remote from the daily life of mankind
than the state. Philanthropy abounded; but religion, once the greatest
social force, had become a thing as private and individual as the estate
of the squire or the working clothes of the labourer. There were special
dispensations and occasional interventions, like the acts of a monarch
who reprieved a criminal or signed an order for his execution. But what
was familiar, and human, and lovable—what was Christian in Christianity
had largely disappeared. God had been thrust into the frigid altitudes
of infinite space. There was a limited monarchy in Heaven, as well as
upon earth. Providence was the spectator of the curious machine which it
had constructed and set in motion, but the operation of which it was
neither able nor willing to control. Like the occasional intervention of
the Crown in the proceedings of Parliament, its wisdom was revealed in
the infrequency of its interference.</p>
<p>The natural consequence of the abdication of authorities which had
stood, however imperfectly, for a common purpose in social organization,
was the gradual disappearance from social thought of the idea of purpose
itself. Its place in the eighteenth century was taken by the idea of
mechanism. The conception of men as united to each other, and of all
mankind as united to God, by mutual obligations arising from their
relation to a common end, ceased to be impressed upon men’s minds, when
Church and State withdrew from the centre of social life to its
circumference. Vaguely conceived and imperfectly realized, it had been
the keystone holding together the social fabric. What remained when the
keystone of the arch was removed, was private rights and private
interests, the materials of a society rather than a society itself.
These rights and interests were the natural order which had been
distorted by the ambitions of kings and priests, and which emerged when
the artificial super-structure disappeared, because they were the
creation, not of man, but of Nature herself. They had been regarded in
the past as relative to some public purpose, whether religion or
national welfare. Henceforward they were thought to be absolute and
indefeasible, and to stand by their own virtue. They were the ultimate
political and social reality; and since they were the ultimate reality,
they were not subordinate to other aspects of society, but other aspects
of society were subordinate to them.</p>
<p>The State could not encroach upon these rights, for the State existed
for their maintenance. They determined the relation of classes, for the
most obvious and fundamental of all rights was property—property
absolute and unconditioned—and those who possessed it were regarded as
the natural governors of those who did not. Society arose from their
exercise, through the contracts of individual with individual. It
fulfilled its object in so far as, by maintaining contractual freedom,
it secured full scope for their unfettered enjoyment. It failed in so
far as, like the French monarchy, it over-rode them by the use of an
arbitrary authority. Thus conceived, society assumed something of the
appearance of a great joint-stock company, in which political power and
the receipt of dividends were justly assigned to those who held the most
numerous shares. The currents of social activity did not converge upon
common ends, but were dispersed through a multitude of channels, created
by the private interests of the individuals who composed society. But in
their very variety and spontaneity, in the very absence of any attempt
to relate them to a larger purpose than that of the individual, lay the
best security of its attainment. There is a mysticism of reason as well
as of emotion, and the eighteenth century found in the beneficence of
natural instincts a substitute for the God whom it had expelled from
contact with society, and did not hesitate to identify them.</p>
<blockquote>
<p> “Thus God and nature planned the general frame</p>
<p>And bade self-love and social be the same.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The result of such ideas in the world of practice was a society which
was ruled by law, not by the caprice of Governments, but which
recognized no moral limitations on the pursuit by individuals of their
economic self-interest. In the world of thought, it was a political
philosophy which made rights the foundation of the social order, and
which considered the discharge of obligations, when it considered it at
all, as emerging by an inevitable process from their free exercise. The
first famous exponent of this philosophy was Locke, in whom the dominant
conception is the indefeasibility of private rights, not the
pre-ordained harmony between private rights and public welfare. In the
great French writers who prepared the way for the Revolution, while
believing that they were the servants of an enlightened absolutism,
there is an almost equal emphasis upon the sanctity of rights and upon
the infallibility of the alchemy by which the pursuit of private ends is
transmuted into the attainment of public good. Though their writings
reveal the influence of the conception of society as a self-adjusting
mechanism, which afterwards became the most characteristic note of
English individualism, what the French Revolution burned into the mind
of Europe was the former not the latter. In England the idea of right
had been negative and defensive, a barrier to the encroachment of
Governments. The French leapt to the attack from trenches which the
English had been content to defend, and in France the idea became
affirmative and militant, not a weapon of defence, but a principle of
social organization. The attempt to refound society upon rights, and
rights springing not from musty charters, but from the very nature of
man himself, was at once the triumph and the limitation of the
Revolution. It gave it the enthusiasm and infectious power of
religion.</p>
<p>What happened in England might seem at first sight to have been
precisely the reverse. English practical men, whose thoughts were
pitched in a lower key, were a little shocked by the pomp and brilliance
of that tremendous creed. They had scanty sympathy with the absolute
affirmations of France. What captured their imagination was not the
right to liberty, which made no appeal to their commercial instincts,
but the expediency of liberty, which did; and, when the Revolution had
revealed the explosive power of the idea of natural right, they sought
some less menacing formula. It had been offered them first by Adam Smith
and his precursors, who showed how the mechanism of economic life
converted “as with an invisible hand,” the exercise of individual rights
into the instrument of public good. Bentham, who despised metaphysical
subtleties, and thought the Declaration of the Rights of Man as absurd
as any other dogmatic religion, completed the new orientation by
supplying the final criterion of political institutions in the principle
of Utility. Henceforward emphasis was transferred from right of the
individual to exercise his freedom as he pleased to the expediency of an
undisturbed exercise of freedom to society.</p>
<p>The change is significant. It is the difference between the universal
and equal citizenship of France, with its five million peasant
proprietors, and the organized inequality of England established solidly
upon class traditions and class institutions; the descent from hope to
resignation, from the fire and passion of an age of illimitable vistas
to the monotonous beat of the factory engine, from Turgot and Condorcet
to the melancholy mathematical creed of Bentham and Ricardo and James
Mill. Mankind has, at least, this superiority over its philosophers,
that great movements spring from the heart and embody a faith, not the
nice adjustments of the hedonistic calculus. So, in the name of the
rights of property, France abolished in three years a great mass of
property rights, which, under the old regime, had robbed the peasant of
part of the produce of his labour, and the social transformation
survived a whole world of political changes.</p>
<p>In England the glad tidings of democracy were broken too discreetly
to reach the ears of the hind in the furrow or the shepherd on the hill;
there were political changes without a social transformation. The
doctrine of Utility, though trenchant in the sphere of politics,
involved no considerable interference with the fundamentals of the
social fabric. Its exponents were principally concerned with the removal
of political abuses and legal anomalies. They attacked sinecures and
pensions and the criminal code and the procedure of the law courts. But
they touched only the surface of social institutions. They thought it a
monstrous injustice that the citizen should pay one-tenth of his income
in taxation to an idle Government, but quite reasonable that he should
pay one-fifth of it in rent to an idle landlord.</p>
<p>The difference, nevertheless, was one of emphasis and expression, not
of principle. It mattered very little in practice whether private
property and unfettered economic freedom were stated, as in France, to
be natural rights, or whether, as in England, they were merely assumed
once for all to be expedient. In either case they were taken for granted
as the fundamentals upon which social organization was to be based, and
about which no further argument was admissible. Though Bentham argued
that rights were derived from utility, not from nature, he did not push
his analysis so far as to argue that any particular right was relative
to any particular function, and thus endorsed indiscriminately rights
which were not accompanied by service as well as rights which were.
While eschewing, in short, the phraseology of natural rights, the
English Utilitarians retained something not unlike the substance of
them. For they assumed that private property in land, and the private
ownership of capital, were natural institutions, and gave them, indeed,
a new lease of life, by proving to their own satisfaction that social
well-being must result from their continued exercise. Their negative was
as important as their positive teaching. It was a conductor which
diverted the lightning. Behind their political theory, behind the
practical conduct, which as always, continues to express theory long
after it has been discredited in the world of thought, lay the
acceptance of absolute rights to property and to economic freedom as the
unquestioned centre of social organization.</p>
<p>The result of that attitude was momentous. The motive and inspiration
of the Liberal Movement of the eighteenth century had been the attack on
Privilege; and, when its main ideas were being hammered out, that attack
was the one supremely necessary thing. In the modern revulsion against
economic tyranny, there is a disposition to represent the writers who
stand on the threshold of the age of capitalist industry as the prophets
of a vulgar materialism, which would sacrifice every human aspiration to
the pursuit of riches. No interpretation could be more misleading; and,
if it is not unnatural in England, applied to France, where the new
faith grew to its fullest stature, it is fantastic. The great
individualists of the eighteenth century, Jefferson and Turgot and
Condorcet and Adam Smith, shot their arrows against the abuses of their
day, not of ours. It is as absurd to criticise them as indifferent to
the evils of a social order which they could not anticipate, as to
appeal to their authority in defence of it.</p>
<p>When they formulated the new philosophy, the obvious abuse was not
the power wielded by the owners of capital over populations unable to
work without their permission; it was the network of customary and legal
restrictions by which the landowner in France, monopolistic corporations
and the State both in France and in England, prevented the individual
from exercising his powers, divorced property from labour, and made
idleness the pensioner of industry. The grand enemy of the age was
monopoly; the battle-cry with which enlightenment marched against it was
the abolition of privilege; its ideal was a society where each man had
free access to the economic opportunities which he could use and enjoyed
the wealth which by his efforts he had created. That school of thought
represented all, or nearly all, that was humane and intelligent in the
mind of the age. It was individualistic, not because it valued riches as
the main end of man, but because it had a high sense of human dignity,
and desired that men should be free to become themselves. And the vulgar
commercialism which in England resisted, and still resists, the
abolition of child labour, derived half its strength from the fact that
the philosophy behind which it sheltered was that, not of reaction, but
of enlightenment.</p>
<p>Of enlightenment, yes. But of an enlightenment which had crystallized
its doctrines while the new industrial order was still young and its
effects unknown. When Adam Smith wrote, the factory system was still in
its infancy; the typical employer was a small master but little removed
from the half dozen journeymen whom he employed; and the modern economic
system, with its centralized control over armies of wage-earners, its
joint-stock companies separating ownership from management, its
combinations controlling a whole industry, was neither seen nor
suspected. Few even now can read Condorcet’s <em>Tableau Historique</em>
without a lifting of the heart. But the creed which had exorcised the
spectre of agrarian feudalism haunting village and <em>chateau</em> in
France was impotent to disarm the new ogre of industrial capitalism who
was stretching his grimy arms in the north of England, for it had never
conceived the possibility of his existence. Hence, with all its
brilliant achievements, the appearance of something belated, something
inapposite and irrelevant which dogs the exponents of that school of
thought when they discuss economic issues after the middle of the
nineteenth century, so different from its trenchant and unswerving
directness in the age of its birth. It is eloquent and humane. But it
seems to repeat the phrases of an age which expired in producing them,
and to do so without knowing it. For since they were minted by the great
masters, the deluge has changed the face of economic society and has
made them phrases and little more.</p>
<p>When, shorn of its splendours and illusions, liberalism triumphed in
England in 1832, it carried without criticism into the new world of
capitalist industry categories of private property and freedom of
contract which had been forged in the simpler economic environment of
the pre-industrial era. In England these categories are being bent and
twisted till they are no longer recognizable, and will, in time, be made
harmless. In America, where necessity compelled the crystallization of
principles in a constitution, they have the rigidity of an iron jacket.
The magnificent formulae in which a society of farmers, merchants and
master craftsmen enshrined its philosophy of freedom are in danger of
becoming fetters used by an Anglo-Saxon business aristocracy to bind
insurgent movements on the part of an immigrant and semi-servile
proletariat.</p>

<section id="the-acquisitive-society" class="level1">
<h1>The Acquisitive Society</h1>
<p>This doctrine has been qualified in practice by particular
limitations to avert particular evils and to meet exceptional
emergencies. But it is limited in special cases precisely because its
general validity is regarded as beyond controversy, and, up to the eve
of the recent war, it was the working faith of modern economic
civilization. What it implies is, that the foundation of society is
found, not in functions, but in rights; that rights are not deducible
from the discharge of functions, so that the acquisition of wealth and
the enjoyment of property are contingent upon the performances of
services, but that the individual enters the world equipped with rights
to the free disposal of his property and the pursuit of his economic
self-interest, and that these rights are anterior to, and independent
of, any service which he may render.</p>
<p>True, the service of society will, in fact, it is assumed, result
from their exercise. But it is not the primary motive and criterion of
industry, but a secondary consequence, which emerges incidentally
through the exercise of rights, a consequence which is attained, indeed,
in practice, but which is attained without being sought. It is not the
end at which economic activity aims, or the standard by which it is
judged, but a by-product, as coal-tar is a by-product of the manufacture
of gas; whether that by-product appears or not, it is not proposed that
the rights themselves should be abdicated. For they are regarded, not as
a conditional trust, but as a property, which may, indeed, give way to
the special exigencies of extraordinary emergencies, but which resumes
its sway when the emergency is over, and in normal times is above
discussion.</p>
<p>That conception is written large over the history of the nineteenth
century, both in England and in America. The doctrine which it inherited
was that property was held by an absolute right on an individual basis,
and to this fundamental it added another, which can be traced in
principal far back into history, but which grew to its full stature only
after the rise of capitalist industry, that societies act both unfairly
and unwisely when they limit opportunities of economic enterprise. Hence
every attempt to impose obligations as a condition of the tenure of
property or of the exercise of economic activity has been met by
uncompromising resistance.</p>
<p>The story of the struggle between humanitarian sentiment and the
theory of property transmitted from the eighteenth century is familiar.
No one has forgotten the opposition offered in the name of the rights of
property to factory legislation, to housing reform, to interference with
the adulteration of goods, even to the compulsory sanitation of private
houses. “May I not do what I like with my own?” was the answer to the
proposal to require a minimum standard of safety and sanitation from the
owners of mills and houses. Even to this day, while an English urban
landlord can cramp or distort the development of a whole city by
withholding land except at fancy prices, English municipalities are
without adequate powers of compulsory purchase, and must either pay
through the nose or see thousands of their members overcrowded. The
whole body of procedure by which they may acquire land, or indeed new
powers of any kind, has been carefully designed by lawyers to protect
owners of property against the possibility that their private rights may
be subordinated to the public interest, because their rights are thought
to be primary and absolute and public interests secondary and
contingent.</p>
<p>No one needs to be reminded, again, of the influence of the same
doctrine in the sphere of taxation. The income tax was excused as a
temporary measure, because the normal society was conceived to be one in
which the individual spent his whole income for himself and owed no
obligations to society on account of it. The death duties were denounced
as robbery, because they implied that the right to benefit by
inheritance was conditional upon a social sanction. The Budget of 1909
created a storm, not because the taxation of land was heavy—in amount
the land-taxes were trifling—but because it was felt to involve the
doctrine that property is not an absolute right, but that it may
properly be accompanied by special obligations, a doctrine which, if
carried to its logical conclusion, would destroy its sanctity by making
ownership no longer absolute but conditional.</p>
<p>Such an implication seems intolerable to an influential body of
public opinion, because it has been accustomed to regard the free
disposal of property, and the unlimited exploitation of economic
opportunities, as rights which are absolute and unconditioned. On the
whole, until recently, this opinion had few antagonists who could not be
ignored. As a consequence the maintenance of property rights has not
been seriously threatened even in those cases in which it is evident
that no service is discharged, directly or indirectly, by their
exercise.</p>
<p>No one supposes, that the owner of urban land, performs <em>qua</em>
owner, any function. He has a right of private taxation; that is all.
But the private ownership of urban land is as secure to-day as it was a
century ago; and Lord Hugh Cecil, in his interesting little book on
Conservatism, declares that, whether private property is mischievous or
not, society cannot interfere with it, because to interfere with it is
theft, and theft is wicked.No one supposes that it is for the public
good that large areas of land should be used for parks and game. But our
country gentlemen are still settled heavily upon their villages and
still slay their thousands. No one can argue that a monopolist is
impelled by “an invisible hand” to serve the public interest. But, over
a considerable field of industry, competition, as the recent Report on
Trusts shows, has been replaced by combination, and combinations are
allowed the same unfettered freedom as individuals in the exploitation
of economic opportunities. No one really believes that the production of
coal depends upon the payment of mining royalties or that ships will not
go to and fro unless ship-owners can earn 50% upon their capital. But
coal mines, or rather the coal miner, still pay royalties, and
ship-owners still make fortunes and are made Peers.</p>
<p>At the very moment when everybody is talking about the importance of
increasing the output of wealth, the last question, apparently, which it
occurs to any statesman to ask is why wealth should be squandered on
futile activities, and in expenditure which is either disproportionate
to service or made for no service at all. So inveterate, indeed, has
become the practice of payment in virtue of property rights, without
even the pretence of any service being rendered, that when, in a
national emergency, it is proposed to extract oil from the ground, the
Government actually proposes that every gallon shall pay a tax to
landowners who never even suspected its existence, and the ingenuous
proprietors are full of pained astonishment at any one questioning
whether the nation is under a moral obligation to endow them further.
Such rights are, strictly speaking, privileges. For the definition of a
privilege is a right to which no corresponding function is attached.</p>
<p>The enjoyment of property and the direction of industry are
considered, in short, to require no social justification, because they
are regarded as rights which stand by their own virtue, not functions to
be judged by the success with which they contribute to a social purpose.
To-day that doctrine, if intellectually discredited, is still the
practical foundation of social organization. How slowly it yields even
to the most insistent demonstration of its inadequacy is shown by the
attitude which the heads of the business world have adopted to the
restrictions imposed on economic activity during the war. The control of
railways, mines, and shipping, the distribution of raw materials through
a public department instead of through competing merchants, the
regulation of prices, the attempts to check “profiteering”—the detailed
application of these measures may have been effective or ineffective,
wise or injudicious. It is evident, indeed, that some of them have been
foolish, like the restriction of imports when the world has five years’
destruction to repair, and that others, if sound in conception, have
been questionable in their execution. If they were attacked on the
ground that they obstruct the efficient performance of function—if the
leaders of industry came forward and said generally, as some, to their
honour, have:—“We accept your policy, but we will improve its execution;
we desire payment for service and service only and will help the state
to see that it pays for nothing else”—there might be controversy as to
the facts, but there could be none as to the principle.</p>
<p>In reality, however, the <em>gravamen</em> of the charges brought
against these restrictions appears generally to be precisely the
opposite. They are denounced by most of their critics not because they
limit the opportunity of service, but because they diminish the
opportunity for gain, not because they prevent the trader enriching the
community, but because they make it more difficult for him to enrich
himself; not, in short, because they have failed to convert economic
activity into a social function, but because they have come too near
succeeding. If the financial adviser to the Coal Controller may be
trusted, the shareholders in coal mines would appear to have done fairly
well during the war. But the proposal to limit their profits to 1s. 2d.
per ton is described by Lord Gainford as “sheer robbery and
confiscation.” With some honourable exceptions, what is demanded is that
in future as in the past the directors of industry should be free to
handle it as an enterprise conducted for their own convenience or
advancement, instead of being compelled, as they have been partially
compelled during the war, to subordinate it to a social purpose.</p>
<p>The demand was to be expected. For to admit that the criterion of
commerce and industry is its success in discharging a social purpose is
at once to turn property and economic activity from rights which are
absolute into rights which are contingent and derivative, because it is
to affirm that they are relative to functions and that they may justly
be revoked when the functions are not performed. It is, in short, to
imply that property and economic activity exist to promote the ends of
society, whereas hitherto society has been regarded in the world of
business as existing to promote them. To those who hold their position,
not as functionaries, but by virtue of their success in making industry
contribute to their own wealth and social influence, such a reversal of
means and ends appears little less than a revolution. For it implies
that they must justify before a social tribunal rights which they have
hitherto taken for granted as part of an order which is above
criticism.</p>
<p>During the greater part of the nineteenth century the significance of
the opposition between the two principles of individual rights and
social functions was masked by the doctrine of the inevitable harmony
between private interests and public good. Competition, it was argued,
was an effective substitute for honesty. To-day that subsidiary doctrine
has fallen to pieces under criticism; few now would profess adherence to
the compound of economic optimism and moral bankruptcy which led a
nineteenth century economist to say: “Greed is held in check by greed,
and the desire for gain sets limits to itself.” The disposition to
regard individual rights as the centre and pivot of society is still,
however, the most powerful element in political thought and the
practical foundation of industrial organization. The laborious
refutation of the doctrine that private and public interests are
co-incident, and that man’s self-love is God’s Providence, which was the
excuse of the last century for its worship of economic egotism, has
achieved, in fact, surprisingly small results. Economic egotism is still
worshipped; and it is worshipped because that doctrine was not really
the centre of the position. It was an outwork, not the citadel, and now
that the outwork has been captured, the citadel is still to win.</p>
<p>What gives its special quality and character, its toughness and
cohesion, to the industrial system built up in the last century and a
half, is not its exploded theory of economic harmonies. It is the
doctrine that economic rights are anterior to, and independent of,
economic functions, that they stand by their own virtue, and need adduce
no higher credentials. The practical result of it is that economic
rights remain, whether economic functions are performed or not. They
remain to-day in a more menacing form than in the age of early
industrialism. For those who control industry no longer compete but
combine, and the rivalry between property in capital and property in
land has long since ended.</p>
<p>The basis of the New Conservatism appears to be a determination so to
organize society, both by political and economic action, as to make it
secure against every attempt to extinguish payments which are made, not
for service, but because the owners possess a right to extract income
without it. Hence the fusion of the two traditional parties, the
proposed “strengthening” of the second chamber, the return to
protection, the swift conversion of rival industrialists to the
advantages of monopoly, and the attempts to buy off with concessions the
more influential section of the working classes. Revolutions, as a long
and bitter experience reveals, are apt to take their colour from the
regime which they overthrow. Is it any wonder that the creed which
affirms the absolute rights of property should sometimes be met with a
counter-affirmation of the absolute rights of labour, less antisocial,
indeed, and inhuman, but almost as dogmatic, almost as intolerant and
thoughtless as itself?</p>
<p>A society which aimed at making the acquisition of wealth contingent
upon the discharge of social obligations, which sought to proportion
remuneration to service and denied it to those by whom no service was
performed, which inquired first, not what men possess, but what they can
make or create or achieve, might be called a Functional Society, because
in such a society the main subject of social emphasis would be the
performance of functions. But such a society does not exist, even as a
remote ideal, in the modern world, though something like it has hung, an
unrealized theory, before men’s minds in the past. Modern societies aim
at protecting economic rights, while leaving economic functions, except
in moments of abnormal emergency, to fulfil themselves.</p>
<p>The motive which gives colour and quality to their public
institutions, to their policy and political thought, is not the attempt
to secure the fulfilment of tasks undertaken for the public service, but
to increase the opportunities open to individuals of attaining the
objects which they conceive to be advantageous to themselves. If asked
the end or criterion of social organization, they would give an answer
reminiscent of the formula the greatest happiness of the greatest
number. But to say that the end of social institutions is happiness, is
to say that they have no common end at all. For happiness is individual,
and to make happiness the object of society is to resolve society itself
into the ambitions of numberless individuals, each directed towards the
attainment of some personal purpose.</p>
<p>Such societies may be called Acquisitive Societies, because their
whole tendency and interest and preoccupation is to promote the
acquisition of wealth. The appeal of this conception must be powerful,
for it has laid the whole modern world under its spell. Since England
first revealed the possibilities of industrialism, it has gone from
strength to strength, and as industrial civilization invades countries
hitherto remote from it, as Russia and Japan and India and China are
drawn into its orbit, each decade sees a fresh extension of its
influence. The secret of its triumph is obvious. It is an invitation to
men to use the powers with which they have been endowed by nature or
society, by skill or energy or relentless egotism or mere good fortune,
without enquiring whether there is any principle by which their exercise
should be limited. It assumes the social organization which determines
the opportunities which different classes shall in fact possess, and
concentrates attention upon the right of those who possess or can
acquire power to make the fullest use of it for their own
self-advancement. By fixing men’s minds, not upon the discharge of
social obligations, which restricts their energy, because it defines the
goal to which it should be directed, but upon the exercise of the right
to pursue their own self-interest, it offers unlimited scope for the
acquisition of riches, and therefore gives free play to one of the most
powerful of human instincts.</p>
<p>To the strong it promises unfettered freedom for the exercise of
their strength; to the weak the hope that they too one day may be
strong. Before the eyes of both it suspends a golden prize, which not
all can attain, but for which each may strive, the enchanting vision of
infinite expansion. It assures men that there are no ends other than
their ends, no law other than their desires, no limit other than that
which they think advisable. Thus it makes the individual the centre of
his own universe, and dissolves moral principles into a choice of
expediencies. And it immensely simplifies the problems of social life in
complex communities. For it relieves them of the necessity of
discriminating between different types of economic activity and
different sources of wealth, between enterprise and avarice, energy and
unscrupulous greed, property which is legitimate and property which is
theft, the just enjoyment of the fruits of labour and the idle
parasitism of birth or fortune, because it treats all economic
activities as standing upon the same level, and suggests that excess or
defect, waste or superfluity, require no conscious effort of the social
will to avert them, but are corrected almost automatically by the
mechanical play of economic forces.</p>
<p>Under the impulse of such ideas men do not become religious or wise
or artistic; for religion and wisdom and art imply the acceptance of
limitations. But they become powerful and rich. They inherit the earth
and change the face of nature, if they do not possess their own souls;
and they have that appearance of freedom which consists in the absence
of obstacles between opportunities for self-advancement and those whom
birth, or wealth, or talent or good fortune have placed in a position to
seize them. It is not difficult either for individuals or for societies
to achieve their object, if that object be sufficiently limited and
immediate, and if they are not distracted from its pursuit by other
considerations. The temper which dedicates itself to the cultivation of
opportunities, and leaves obligations to take care of themselves, is set
upon an object which is at once simple and practicable. The eighteenth
century defined it. The twentieth century has very largely attained it.
Or, if it has not attained it, it has at least grasped the possibilities
of its attainment. The national output of wealth per head of population
is estimated to have been approximately £40 in 1914. Unless mankind
chooses to continue the sacrifice of prosperity to the ambitions and
terrors of nationalism, it is possible that by the year 2000 it may be
doubled.</p>

<section id="the-nemesis-of-industrialism" class="level1">
<h1>The Nemesis of Industrialism</h1>
<p>Such happiness is not remote from achievement. In the course of
achieving it, however, the world has been confronted by a group of
unexpected consequences, which are the cause of its <em>malaise</em>, as
the obstruction of economic opportunity was the cause of social
<em>malaise</em> in the eighteenth century. And these consequences are
not, as is often suggested, accidental mal-adjustments, but flow
naturally from its dominant principle: so that there is a sense in which
the cause of its perplexity is not its failure, but the quality of its
success, and its light itself a kind of darkness.</p>
<p>The will to economic power, if it is sufficiently single-minded,
brings riches. But if it is single-minded it destroys the moral
restraints which ought to condition the pursuit of riches, and therefore
also makes the pursuit of riches meaningless. For what gives meaning to
economic activity, as to any other activity, is, as we have said, the
purpose to which it is directed. But the faith upon which our economic
civilization reposes, the faith that riches are not a means but an end,
implies that all economic activity is equally estimable, whether it is
subordinated to a social purpose or not. Hence it divorces gain from
service, and justifies rewards for which no function is performed, or
which are out of all proportion to it. Wealth in modern societies is
distributed according to opportunity; and while opportunity depends
partly upon talent and energy, it depends still more upon birth, social
position, access to education and inherited wealth; in a word upon
property. For talent and energy can create opportunity. But property
need only wait for it. It is the sleeping partner who draws part of the
dividends which the firm produces, the residuary legatee who always
claims his share in the estate.</p>
<p>Because rewards are divorced from services, so that what is prized
most is not riches obtained in return for labour but riches the economic
origin of which, being regarded as sordid, is concealed, two results
follow. The first is the creation of a class of pensioners upon
industry, who levy toll upon its product, but contribute nothing to its
increase, and who are not merely tolerated, but applauded and admired
and protected with assiduous care, as though the secret of prosperity
resided in them. They are admired because in the absence of any
principle of discrimination between incomes which are payment for
functions and incomes which are not, all incomes, merely because they
represent wealth, stand on the same level of appreciation, and are
estimated solely by their magnitude, so that in all societies which have
accepted industrialism there is an upper layer which claims the
enjoyment of social life, while it repudiates its responsibilities. The
<em>rentier</em> and his ways, how familiar they were in England before
the war! A public school and then club life in Oxford and Cambridge, and
then another club in town; London in June, when London is pleasant, the
moors in August, and pheasants in October, Cannes in December and
hunting in February and March; and a whole world of rising bourgeoisie
eager to imitate them, sedulous to make their expensive watches keep
time with this preposterous calendar!</p>
<p>The second consequence is the degradation of those who labour, but
who do not by their labour command large rewards; that is of the great
majority of mankind. And this degradation follows inevitably from the
refusal of men to give the purpose of industry the first place in their
thoughts about it. When they do that, when their minds are set upon the
fact that the meaning of industry is the service of man, all who labour
appear to them honourable, because all who labour serve, and the
distinction which separates those who serve from those who merely spend
is so crucial and fundamental as to obliterate all minor distinctions
based on differences of income. But when the criterion of function is
forgotten, the only criterion which remains is that of wealth, and an
Acquisitive Society reverences the possession of wealth, as a Functional
Society would honour, even in the person of the humblest and most
laborious craftsman, the arts of creation.</p>
<p>So wealth becomes the foundation of public esteem, and the mass of
men who labour, but who do not acquire wealth, are thought to be vulgar
and meaningless and insignificant compared with the few who acquire
wealth by good fortune, or by the skilful use of economic opportunities.
They come to be regarded, not as the ends for which alone it is worth
while to produce wealth at all, but as the instruments of its
acquisition by a world that declines to be soiled by contact with what
is thought to be the dull and sordid business of labour. They are not
happy, for the reward of all but the very mean is not merely money, but
the esteem of their fellow men, and they know they are not esteemed, as
soldiers, for example, are esteemed, though it is because they give
their lives to making civilization that there is a civilization which it
is worth while for soldiers to defend. They are not esteemed, because
the admiration of society is directed towards those who get, not towards
those who give; and though workmen give much they get little. And the
<em>rentiers</em> whom they support are not happy; for in discarding the
idea of function, which sets a limit to the acquisition of riches, they
have also discarded the principle which alone gives riches their
meaning. Hence unless they can persuade themselves that to be rich is in
itself meritorious, they may bask in social admiration, but they are
unable to esteem themselves. For they have abolished the principle which
makes activity significant, and therefore estimable. They are, indeed,
more truly pitiable than some of those who envy them. For, like the
spirits in the Inferno, they are punished by the attainment of their
desires.</p>
<p>A society ruled by these notions is necessarily the victim of an
irrational inequality. To escape such inequality it is necessary to
recognize that there is some principle which ought to limit the gains of
particular classes and particular individuals, because gains drawn from
certain sources or exceeding certain amounts are illegitimate. But such
a limitation implies a standard of discrimination, which is inconsistent
with the assumption that each man has a right to what he can get,
irrespective of any service rendered for it. Thus privilege, which was
to have been exorcised by the gospel of 1789, returns in a new guise,
the creature no longer of unequal legal rights thwarting the natural
exercise of equal powers of hand and brain, but of unequal powers
springing from the exercise of equal rights in a world where property
and inherited wealth and the apparatus of class institutions have made
opportunities unequal.</p>
<p>Inequality, again, leads to the misdirection of production. For,
since the demand of one income of £50,000 is as powerful a magnet as the
demand of 500 incomes of £100, it diverts energy from the creation of
wealth to the multiplication of luxuries, so that, for example, while
one-tenth of the people of England are overcrowded, a considerable part
of them are engaged, not in supplying that deficiency, but in making
rich men’s hotels, luxurious yachts, and motor-cars like that used by a
Secretary of State for War, “with an interior inlaid with silver in
quartered mahogany, and upholstered in fawn suede and morocco,” which
was afterwards bought by a suburban capitalist, by way of encouraging
useful industries and rebuking pubHc extravagance with an example of
private economy, for the trifling sum of 3,550 guineas.</p>
<p>Thus part of the goods which are annually produced, and which are
called wealth, is, strictly speaking, waste, because it consists of
articles which, though reckoned as a part of the income of the nation,
either should not have been produced until other articles had already
been produced in sufficient abundance, or should not have been produced
at all. And some part of the population is employed in making goods
which no man can make with happiness, or indeed without loss of
self-respect, because he knows that they had much better not be made,
and that his life is wasted in making them. Everybody recognizes that
the army contractor, who, in time of war, set several hundred navvies to
dig an artificial lake in his grounds, was not adding to, but
subtracting from, the wealth of the nation. But in time of peace many
hundred thousand workmen, if they are not digging ponds, are doing work
which is equally foolish and wasteful; though, in peace, as in war,
there is important work, which is waiting to be done, and which is
neglected.</p>
<p>It is neglected because, while the effective demand of the mass of
men is only too small, there is a small class which wears several men’s
clothes, eats several men’s dinners, occupies several families’ houses,
and lives several men’s lives. As long as a minority has so large an
income that part of it, if spent at all, must be spent on trivialities,
so long will part of the human energy and mechanical equipment of the
nation be diverted from serious work, which enriches it, to making
trivialities, which impoverishes it, since they can only be made at the
cost of not making other things. And if the peers and millionaires who
are now preaching the duty of production to miners and dock labourers
desire that more wealth, not more waste, should be produced, the
simplest way in which they can achieve their aim is to transfer to the
public their whole incomes over (say) £1,000 a year, in order that it
may be spent in setting to work, not gardeners, chauffeurs, domestic
servants and shopkeepers in the West End of London, but builders,
mechanics and teachers.</p>
<p>So to those who clamour, as many now do, “Produce! Produce!” one
simple question may be addressed:—“Produce what?” Food, clothing,
house-room, art, knowledge? By all means! But if the nation is scantily
furnished with these things had it not better stop producing a good many
others which fill shop windows in Regent Street? If it desires to
re-equip its industries with machinery and its railways with wagons, had
it not better refrain from holding exhibitions designed to encourage
rich men to re-equip themselves with motor-cars? What can be more
childish than to urge the necessity that productive power should be
increased, if part of the productive power which exists already is
misapplied? Is not <em>less</em> production of futilities as important
as, indeed a condition of, <em>more</em> production of things of moment?
Would not “Spend less on private luxuries” be as wise a cry as “produce
more?” Yet this result of inequality, again, is a phenomenon which
cannot be prevented, or checked, or even recognized by a society which
excludes the idea of purpose from its social arrangements and industrial
activity. For to recognize it is to admit that there is a principle
superior to the mechanical play of economic forces, which ought to
determine the relative importance of different occupations, and thus to
abandon the view that all riches, however composed, are an end, and that
all economic activity is equally justifiable.</p>
<p>The rejection of the idea of purpose involves another consequence
which every one laments, but which no one can prevent, except by
abandoning the belief that the free exercise of rights is the main
interest of society and the discharge of obligations a secondary and
incidental consequence which may be left to take care of itself. It is
that social life is turned into a scene of fierce antagonisms, and that
a considerable part of industry is carried on in the intervals of a
disguised social war. The idea that industrial peace can be secured
merely by the exercise of tact and forbearance is based on the idea that
there is a fundamental identity of interest between the different groups
engaged in it, which is occasionally interrupted by regrettable
misunderstandings. Both the one idea and the other are an illusion. The
disputes which matter are not caused by a misunderstanding of identity
of interests, but by a better understanding of diversity of interests.
Though a formal declaration of war is an episode, the conditions which
issue in a declaration of war are permanent; and what makes them
permanent is the conception of industry which also makes inequality and
functionless incomes permanent. It is the denial that industry has any
end or purpose other than the satisfaction of those engaged in it.</p>
<p>That motive produces industrial warfare, not as a regrettable
incident, but as an inevitable result. It produces industrial war,
because its teaching is that each individual or group has a right to
what they can get, and denies that there is any principle, other than
the mechanism of the market, which determines what they ought to get.
For, since the income available for distribution is limited, and since,
therefore, when certain limits have been passed, what one group gains
another group must lose, it is evident that if the relative incomes of
different groups are not to be determined by their functions, there is
no method other than mutual self-assertion which is left to determine
them. Self-interest, indeed, may cause them to refrain from using their
full strength to enforce their claims, and, in so far as this happens,
peace is secured in industry, as men have attempted to secure it in
international affairs, by a balance of power. But the maintenance of
such a peace is contingent upon the estimate of the parties to it that
they have more to lose than to gain by an overt struggle, and is not the
result of their acceptance of any standard of remuneration as an
equitable settlement of their claims. Hence it is precarious, insincere
and short. It is without finality, because there can be no finality in
the mere addition of increments of income, any more than in the
gratification of any other desire for material goods. When demands are
conceded the old struggle recommences upon a new level, and will always
recommence as long as men seek to end it merely by increasing
remuneration, not by finding a principle upon which all remuneration,
whether large or small, should be based.</p>
<p>Such a principle is offered by the idea of function, because its
application would eliminate the surpluses which are the subject of
contention, and would make it evident that remuneration is based upon
service, not upon chance or privilege or the power to use opportunities
to drive a hard bargain. But the idea of function is incompatible with
the doctrine that every person and organization have an unlimited right
to exploit their economic opportunities as fully as they please, which
is the working faith of modern industry; and, since it is not accepted,
men resign themselves to the settlement of the issue by force, or
propose that the State should supersede the force of private
associations by the use of its force, as though the absence of a
principle could be compensated by a new kind of machinery. Yet all the
time the true cause of industrial warfare is as simple as the true cause
of international warfare. It is that if men recognize no law superior to
their desires, then they must fight when their desires collide; for
though groups or nations which are at issue with each other may be
willing to submit to a principle which is superior to them both, there
is no reason why they should submit to each other.</p>
<p>Hence the idea, which is popular with rich men, that industrial
disputes would disappear if only the output of wealth were doubled, and
every one were twice as well off, not only is refuted by all practical
experience, but is in its very nature founded upon an illusion. For the
question is one, not of amounts, but of proportions; and men will fight
to be paid £30 a week, instead of £20, as readily as they will fight to
be paid £5 instead of £4, as long as there is no reason why they should
be paid £20 instead of £30, and as long as other men who do not work are
paid anything at all. If miners demanded higher wages when every
superfluous charge upon coal-getting had been eliminated, there would be
a principle with which to meet their claims, the principle that one
group of workers ought not to encroach upon the livelihood of others.
But as long as mineral owners extract royalties, and exceptionally
productive mines pay 30% to absentee shareholders, there is no valid
answer to a demand for higher wages. For if the community pays anything
at all to those who do not work, it can afford to pay more to those who
do. The naive complaint, that workmen are never satisfied, is,
therefore, strictly true. It is true, not only of workmen, but of all
classes in a society which conducts its affairs on the principle that
wealth, instead of being proportioned to function, belongs to those who
can get it. They are never satisfied, nor can they be satisfied. For as
long as they make that principle the guide of their individual lives and
of their social order, nothing short of infinity could bring them
satisfaction.</p>
<p>So here, again, the prevalent insistence upon rights, and prevalent
neglect of functions, brings men into a vicious circle from which they
cannot escape, without escaping from the false philosophy which
dominates them. But it does something more. It makes that philosophy
itself seem plausible and exhilarating, and a rule not only for
industry, in which it had its birth, but for politics and culture and
religion and the whole compass of social life. The possibility that one
aspect of human life may be so exaggerated as to overshadow, and in time
to atrophy, every other, has been made familiar to Englishmen by the
example of “Prussian militarism.” Militarism is the characteristic, not
of an army, but of a society. Its essence is not any particular quality
or scale of military preparation, but a state of mind, which, in its
concentration on one particular element in social life, ends finally by
exalting it until it be comes the arbiter of all the rest. The purpose
for which military forces exist is forgotten. They are thought to stand
by their own right and to need no justification. Instead of being
regarded as an instrument which is necessary in an imperfect world, they
are elevated into an object of superstitious veneration, as though the
world would be a poor insipid place without them, so that political
institutions and social arrangements and intellect and morality and
religion are crushed into a mould made to fit one activity, which in a
sane society is a subordinate activity, like the police, or the
maintenance of prisons, or the cleansing of sewers, but which in a
militarist state is a kind of mystical epitome of society itself.</p>
<p>Militarism, as Englishmen see plainly enough, is fetish worship. It
is the prostration of men’s souls and the laceration of their bodies to
appease an idol. What they do not see is that their reverence for
economic activity and industry and what is called business is also
fetish worship, and that, in their devotion to that idol, they torture
themselves as needlessly and indulge in the same meaningless antics as
the Prussians did in their worship of militarism. For what the military
tradition and spirit did for Prussia, with the result of creating
militarism, the commercial tradition and spirit have done for England,
with the result of creating industrialism. Industrialism is no more the
necessary characteristic of an economically developed society than
militarism is a necessary characteristic of a nation which maintains
military forces. It is no more the result of applying science to
industry than militarism is the result of the application of science to
war, and the idea that it is something inevitable in a community which
uses coal and iron and machinery, so far from being the truth, is itself
a product of the perversion of mind which industrialism produces. Men
may use what mechanical instruments they please and be none the worse
for their use. What kills their souls is when they allow their
instruments to use <em>them</em>. The essence of industrialism, in
short, is not any particular method of industry, but a particular
estimate of the importance of industry, which results in it being
thought the only thing that is important at all, so that it is elevated
from the subordinate place which it should occupy among human interests
and activities into being the standard by which all other interests and
activities are judged.</p>
<p>When a Cabinet Minister declares that the greatness of this country
depends upon the volume of its exports, so that France, which exports
comparatively little, and Elizabethan England, which exported next to
nothing, are presumably to be pitied as altogether inferior
civilizations, that is Industrialism. It is the confusion of one minor
department of life with the whole of life. When manufacturers cry and
cut themselves with knives, because it is proposed that boys and girls
of fourteen shall attend school for eight hours a week, and the
President of the Board of Education is so gravely impressed by their
apprehensions, that he at once allows the hours to be reduced to seven,
and then suspends the system altogether, that is Industrialism. It is
fetish worship. When the Government obtains money for a war, which costs
£7,000,000 a day, by closing the Museums, which cost £20,000 a year,
that is Industrialism. It is a contempt for all interests which do not
contribute obviously to economic activity. When the Press clamours that
the one thing needed to make this island an Arcadia is productivity, and
more productivity, and yet more productivity, that is Industrialism. It
is the confusion of means with ends.</p>
<p>Men will always confuse means with ends if they are without any clear
conception that it is the ends, not the means, which matter—if they
allow their minds to slip from the fact that it is the social purpose of
industry which gives it meaning and makes it worth while to carry it on
at all. And when they do that, they will turn their whole world upside
down, because they do not see the poles upon which it ought to move. So
when, like England, they are thoroughly industrialized, they behave like
Prussia, which was thoroughly militarized. They talk as though man
existed for industry, instead of industry existing for man, as the
Prussians sometimes talked of man existing for war. They resent any
activity which is not coloured by the predominant interest, because it
seems a rival to it. So they destroy religion and art and morality,
which cannot exist unless they are disinterested; and having destroyed
these, which are the end, for the sake of industry, which is a means,
they make their industry itself what they make their cities, a desert of
unnatural dreariness, which only forgetfulness can make endurable, and
which only excitement can enable them to forget.</p>
<p>Torn by suspicions and recriminations, avid of power and oblivious of
duties, desiring peace, but unable to “seek peace and ensue it,” because
unwilling to surrender the creed which is the cause of war, to what can
one compare such a society but to the international world, which also
has been called a society, and which also is social in nothing but name?
And the comparison is more than a play upon words. It is an analogy
which has its roots in the facts of history. It is not a chance that the
last two centuries, which saw the growth of a new system of industry,
saw also the growth of the system of international politics which came
to a climax in the period from 1870 to 1914. Both the one and the other
are the expression of the same spirit and move in obedience to similar
laws. The essence of the former was the repudiation of any authority
superior to the individual reason. It left men free to follow their own
interests or ambitions or appetites, untrammelled by subordination to
any common centre of allegiance. The essence of the latter was the
repudiation of any authority superior to the sovereign state, which
again was conceived as a compact self-contained unit—a unit which would
lose its very essence if it lost its independence of other states. Just
as the one emancipated economic activity from a mesh of antiquated
traditions, so the other emancipated nations from arbitrary
subordination to alien races or Governments, and turned them into
nationalities with a right to work out their own destiny.</p>
<p>Nationalism is, in fact, the counterpart among nations of what
individualism is within them. It has similar origins and tendencies,
similar triumphs and defects. For nationalism, like individualism, lays
its emphasis on the rights of separate units, not on their subordination
to common obligations, though its units are races or nations, not
individual men. Like individualism it appeals to the self-assertive
instincts, to which it promises opportunities of unlimited expansion.
Like individualism it is a force of immense explosive power, the just
claims of which must be conceded before it is possible to invoke any
alternative principle to control its operations. For one cannot impose a
super-national authority upon irritated or discontented or oppressed
nationalities, any more than one can subordinate economic motives to the
control of society, until society has recognized that there is a sphere
which they may legitimately occupy.</p>
<p>And, like nationalism, if pushed to its logical conclusion,
individualism, is self-destructive. For, as nationalism, in its
brilliant youth, begins as a claim that nations, because they are
spiritual beings, shall determine themselves, and passes too often into
a claim that they shall dominate others, so individualism begins by
asserting the right of men to make of their own lives what they can, and
ends by condoning the subjection of the majority of men to the few whom
good fortune, or special opportunity, or privilege have enabled most
successfully to use their rights. They rose together. It is probable
that, if ever they decline, they will decline together. For life cannot
be cut in compartments. In the long run the world reaps in war what it
sows in peace. And to expect that international rivalry can be exorcised
as long as the industrial order within each nation is such as to give
success to those whose whole existence is a struggle for
self-aggrandizement is a dream which has not even the merit of being
beautiful.</p>
<p>So the perversion of nationalism is imperialism, as the perversion of
individualism is industrialism. And the perversion comes, not through
any flaw or vice in human nature, but by the force of the idea, because
the principle is defective and reveals its defects as it reveals its
power. For it asserts that the rights of nations and individuals are
absolute, which is false, instead of asserting that they are absolute in
their own sphere, but that their sphere itself is contingent upon the
part which they play in the community of nations and individuals, which
is true. Thus it constrains them to a career of indefinite expansion, in
which they devour continents and oceans, law, morality and religion, and
last of all their own souls, in an attempt to attain infinity by the
addition to themselves of all that is finite. In the meantime their
rivals, and their subjects, and they themselves are conscious of the
danger of opposing forces, and seek to purchase security and to avoid a
collision by organizing a balance of power. But the balance, whether in
international politics or in industry, is unstable, because it reposes
not on the common recognition of a principle by which the claims of
nations and individuals are limited, but on an attempt to find an
equipoise which may avoid a conflict without abjuring the assertion of
unlimited claims. No such equipoise can be found, because, in a world
where the possibilities of increasing military or industrial power are
illimitable, no such equipoise can exist.</p>
<p>Thus, as long as men move on this plane, there is no solution. They
can obtain peace only by surrendering the claim to the unfettered
exercise of their rights, which is the cause of war. What we have been
witnessing, in short, during the past seven years, both in international
affairs and in industry, is the breakdown of the organization of society
on the basis of rights divorced from obligations. Sooner or later the
collapse was inevitable, because the basis was too narrow. For a right
is simply a power which is secured by legal sanctions, “a capacity,” as
the lawyers define it, “residing in one man, of controlling, with the
assistance of the state, the action of others,” and a right should not
be absolute for the same reason that a power should not be absolute. No
doubt it is better that individuals should have absolute rights than
that the State or the Government should have them; and it was the
reaction against the abuses of absolute power by the State which led in
the eighteenth century to the declaration of the absolute rights of
individuals. The most obvious defence against the assertion of one
extreme was the assertion of the other. Because Governments and the
relics of feudalism had encroached upon the property of individuals it
was affirmed that the right of property was absolute; because they had
strangled enterprise, it was affirmed that every man had a natural right
to conduct his business as he pleased.</p>
<p>But, in reality, both the one assertion and the other are false, and,
if applied to practice, must lead to disaster. The State has no absolute
rights; they are limited by its commission. The individual has no
absolute rights; they are relative to the function which he performs in
the community of which he is a member, because, unless they are so
limited, the consequence must be something in the nature of private war.
All rights, in short, are conditional and derivative, because all power
should be conditional and derivative. They are derived from the end or
purpose of the society in which they exist. They are conditional on
being used to contribute to the attainment of that end, not to thwart
it. And this means in practice that, if society is to be healthy, men
must regard themselves not as the owners of rights, but as trustees for
the discharge of functions and the instruments of a social purpose.</p>

<section id="property-and-creative-work" class="level1">
<h1>Property and Creative Work</h1>
<p>The application of the principle that society should be organized
upon the basis of functions, is not recondite, but simple and direct. It
offers in the first place, a standard for discriminating between those
types of private property which are legitimate and those which are not.
During the last century and a half, political thought has oscillated
between two conceptions of property, both of which, in their different
ways, are extravagant.</p>
<p>On the one hand, the practical foundation of social organization has
been the doctrine that the particular forms of private property which
exist at any moment are a thing sacred and inviolable, that anything may
properly become the object of property rights, and that, when it does,
the title to it is absolute and unconditioned. The modern industrial
system took shape in an age when this theory of property was triumphant.
The American Constitution and the French Declaration of the Rights of
Man both treated property as one of the fundamental rights which
Governments exist to protect. The English Revolution of 1688, undogmatic
and reticent though it was, had in effect done the same. The great
individualists from Locke to Turgot, Adam Smith and Bentham all
repeated, in different language, a similar conception. Though what gave
the Revolution its diabolical character in the eyes of the EngHsh upper
classes was its treatment of property, the dogma of the sanctity of
private property was maintained as tenaciously by French Jacobins as by
English Tories; and the theory that property is an absolute, which is
held by many modern Conservatives, is identical, if only they knew it,
with that not only of the men of 1789, but of the terrible Convention
itself.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the attack has been almost as undiscriminating as
the defence. “Private property” has been the central position against
which the social movement of the last hundred years has directed its
forces. The criticism of it has ranged from an imaginative communism in
the most elementary and personal of necessaries, to prosaic and
partially realized proposals to transfer certain kinds of property from
private to public ownership, or to limit their exploitation by
restrictions imposed by the State. But, however varying in emphasis and
in method, the general note of what may conveniently be called the
Socialist criticism of property is what the word Socialism itself
implies. Its essence is the statement that the economic evils of society
are primarily due to the unregulated operation, under modern conditions
of industrial organization, of the institution of private property.</p>
<p>The divergence of opinion is natural, since in most discussions of
property the opposing theorists have usually been discussing different
things. Property is the most ambiguous of categories. It covers a
multitude of rights which have nothing in common except that they are
exercised by persons and enforced by the State. Apart from these formal
characteristics, they vary indefinitely in economic character, in social
effect, and in moral justification. They may be conditional like the
grant of patent rights, or absolute like the ownership of ground rents,
terminable like copyright, or permanent like a freehold, as
comprehensive as sovereignty or as restricted as an easement, as
intimate and personal as the ownership of clothes and books, or as
remote and intangible as shares in a gold mine or rubber plantation.</p>
<p>It is idle, therefore, to present a case for or against private
property without specifying the particular forms of property to which
reference is made, and the journalist who says that “private property is
the foundation of civilization” agrees with Proudhon, who said that it
was theft, in this respect at least that, without further definition,
the words of both are meaningless. Arguments which support or demolish
certain kinds of property may have no application to others;
considerations which are conclusive in one stage of economic
organization may be almost irrelevant in the next. The course of wisdom
is neither to attack private property in general nor to defend it in
general; for things are not similar in quality, merely because they are
identical in name. It is to discriminate between the various concrete
embodiments of what, in itself, is, after all, little more than an
abstraction.</p>
<section id="a-the-traditional-doctrine" class="level2">
<h2>(a) The Traditional Doctrine</h2>
<p>The origin and development of different kinds of proprietary rights
is not material to this discussion. Whatever may have been the
historical process by which they have been established and recognized,
the <em>rationale</em> of private property traditional in England is
that which sees in it either the results of the personal labour of its
owner, or—what is in effect the same thing—the security that each man
will reap where he has sown. Locke argued that a man necessarily and
legitimately becomes the owner of “whatsoever he removes out of the
state that nature hath provided,” and that “he makes it his property”
because he “hath mixed his labour with it.” Paley derived property from
the fact that “it is the intention of God that the produce of the earth
be applied to the use of man, and this intention cannot be fulfilled
without establishing property.” Adam Smith, who wrote the dangerous
sentence, “Civil Government, in so far as it is instituted for the
protection of property, is in reality instituted for the defence of the
rich against the poor,” sometimes spoke of property as the result of
usurpation—“Landlords, like other men, love to reap where they have
never sowed”—but in general ascribed it to the need of offering
protection to productive effort. “If I despair of enjoying the fruits of
labour,” said Bentham, repeating what were in all essentials the
utilitarian arguments of Hume, “I shall only live from day to day; I
shall not undertake labours which will only benefit my enemies.” This
theory passed into America, and became the foundation of the sanctity
ascribed to property in <em>The Federalist</em> and implied in a long
line of judicial decisions on the Fourteenth Amendment to the
Constitution. Property, it is argued, is a moral right, and not merely a
legal right, because it insures that the producer will not be deprived
by violence of the result of his efforts.</p>
<p>The period from which that doctrine was inherited differed from our
own in three obvious, but significant, respects. Property in land and in
the simple capital used in most industries was widely distributed.
Before the rise of capitalist agriculture and capitalist industry, the
ownership, or at any rate the secure and effective occupation, of land
and tools by those who used them, was a condition precedent to effective
work in the field or in the workshop. The forces which threatened
property were the fiscal policy of Governments and in some countries,
for example France, the decaying relics of feudalism. The interference
both of the one and of the other involved the sacrifice of those who
carried on useful labour to those who did not. To resist them was to
protect not only property but industry, which was indissolubly connected
with it. Too often, indeed, resistance was ineffective. Accustomed to
the misery of the rural proprietor in France, Voltaire remarked with
astonishment that in England the peasant may be rich, and “does not fear
to increase the number of his beasts or to cover his roof with tiles.”
And the English Parliamentarians and the French philosophers who made
the inviolability of property rights the centre of their political
theory, when they defended those who owned, were incidentally, if
sometimes unintentionally, defending those who laboured. They were
protecting the yeoman, or the master craftsman, or the merchant from
seeing the fruits of his toil squandered by the hangers-on at St. James
or the courtly parasites of Versailles.</p>
<p>In such circumstances the doctrine which found the justification of
private property in the fact that it enabled the industrious man to reap
where he had sown, was not a paradox, but, as far as the mass of the
population was concerned, almost a truism. Property was defended as the
most sacred of rights. But it was defended as a right which was not only
widely exercised, but which was indispensable to the performance of the
active function of providing food and clothing. For it consisted
predominantly of one of two types, land or tools which were used by the
owner for the purpose of production, and personal possessions which were
the necessities or amenities of civilized existence. The former had its
<em>rationale</em> in the fact that the land of the peasant or the tools
of the craftsman were the condition of his rendering the economic
services which society required; the latter because furniture and
clothes are indispensable to a life of decency and comfort.</p>
<p>The proprietary rights—and, of course, they were numerous—which had
their source, not in work, but in predatory force, were protected from
criticism by the wide distribution of some kind of property among the
mass of the population, and in England, at least, the cruder of them
were gradually whittled down. When property in land and such simple
capital as existed were generally diffused among all classes of society,
when, in most parts of England, the typical workman was not a labourer
but a peasant or small master, who could point to the strips which he
had ploughed or the cloth which he had woven, when the greater part of
the wealth passing at death consisted of land, household furniture and a
stock in trade which was hardly distinguishable from it, the moral
justification of the title to property was self-evident. It was
obviously, what theorists said that it was, and plain men knew it to be,
the labour spent in producing, acquiring and administering it.</p>
<p>Such property was not a burden upon society, but a condition of its
health and efficiency, and indeed, of its continued existence. To
protect it was to maintain the organization through which public
necessities were supplied. If, as in Tudor England, the peasant was
evicted from his holding to make room for sheep, or crushed, as in
eighteenth century France, by arbitrary taxation and seigneurial dues,
land went out of cultivation and the whole community was short of food.
If the tools of the carpenter or smith were seized, ploughs were not
repaired or horses shod. Hence, before the rise of a commercial
civilization, it was the mark of statesmanship, alike in the England of
the Tudors and in the France of Henry IV, to cherish the small
property-owner even to the point of offending the great. Popular
sentiment idealized the yeoman—“the Joseph of the country who keeps the
poor from starving”—not merely because he owned property, but because he
worked on it. It denounced that “bringing of the livings of many into
the hands of one,” which capitalist societies regard with equanimity as
an inevitable, and, apparently, a laudable result of economic
development, cursed the usurer who took advantage of his neighbour’s
necessities to live without labour, and was shocked by the callous
indifference to public welfare shown by those who “not having before
their eyes either God or the profit and advantage of the realm, have
enclosed with hedges and dykes towns and hamlets.” And it was
sufficiently powerful to compel Governments to intervene to prevent the
laying of field to field, and the engrossing of looms—to set limits, in
short, to the scale to which property might grow.</p>
<p>When Bacon, who commended Henry VII for protecting the tenant right
of the small farmer, and pleaded in the House of Commons for more
drastic land legislation, wrote “Wealth is like muck. It is not good but
if it be spread,” he was expressing in an epigram what was the
commonplace of every writer on politics from Fortescue at the end of the
fifteenth century to Harrington in the middle of the seventeenth. The
modern conservative, who is inclined to take <em>au pied de la
lettre</em> the vigorous argument in which Lord Hugh Cecil denounces the
doctrine that the maintenance of proprietary rights ought to be
contingent upon the use to which they are put, may be reminded that Lord
Hugh’s own theory is of a kind to make his ancestors turn in their
graves. Of the two members of the family who achieved distinction before
the nineteenth century, the elder advised the Crown to prevent landlords
evicting tenants, and actually proposed to fix a pecuniary maximum to
the property which different classes might possess; the younger attacked
enclosing in Parliament, and carried legislation compelling landlords to
build cottages, to let them with small holdings, and to plough up
pasture.</p>
<p>William and Robert Cecil were sagacious and responsible men, and
their view that the protection of property should be accompanied by the
enforcement of obligations upon its owners was shared by most of their
contemporaries. The idea that the institution of private property
involves the right of the owner to use it, or refrain from using it, in
such a way as he may please, and that its principal significance is to
supply him with an income, irrespective of any duties which he may
discharge, would not have been understood by most public men of that
age, and, if understood, would have been repudiated with indignation by
the more reputable among them. They found the meaning of property in the
public purposes to which it contributed, whether they were the
production of food, as among the peasantry, or the management of public
affairs, as among the gentry, and hesitated neither to maintain those
kinds of property which met these obligations nor to repress those uses
of it which appeared likely to conflict with them.</p>
<p>Property was to be an aid to creative work, not an alternative to it.
The patentee was secured protection for a new invention, in order to
secure him the fruits of his own brain, but the monopolist who grew fat
on the industry of others was to be put down. The law of the village
bound the peasant to use his land, not as he himself might find most
profitable, but to grow the corn the village needed. The law of the
State forbade the landlord to “depopulate” villages, or to convert
arable to pasture. Long after political changes had made direct
interference impracticable, even the higher ranks of English landowners
continued to discharge, however capriciously and tyrannically, duties
which were vaguely felt to be the contribution which they made to the
public service in virtue of their estates. When as in France, the
obligations of ownership were repudiated almost as completely as they
have been by the owner of to-day, nemesis came in an onslaught upon the
position of a <em>noblesse</em> which had retained its rights and
abdicated its functions. Property reposed, in short, not merely upon
convenience, or on the appetite for gain, but on a moral principle. It
was protected not only for the sake of those who owned, but for the sake
of those who worked and of those for whom their work provided. It was
protected, because, without security for property, wealth could not be
produced or the business of society carried on.</p>

<section id="b-the-divorce-of-ownership-and-work" class="level2">
<h2>(b) The Divorce of Ownership and Work</h2>
<p>Whatever the future may contain, the past has shown no more excellent
social order than that in which the mass of the people were the masters
of the holdings which they ploughed and of the tools with which they
worked, and could boast, with the English freeholder, that “it is a
quietness to a man’s mind to live upon his own and to know his heir
certain.” With this conception of property and its practical expression
in social institutions those who urge that society should be organized
on the basis of function have no quarrel. It is in agreement with their
own doctrine, since it justifies property by reference to the services
which it enables its owner to perform. All that they need ask is that it
should be carried to its logical conclusion.</p>
<p>For the argument has evidently more than one edge. If it justifies
certain types of property, it condemns others; and in the conditions of
modern industrial civilization, what it justifies is less than what it
condemns. The truth is, indeed, that this theory of property, and the
institutions in which it is embodied, have survived into an age in which
the whole structure of society is radically different from that in which
it was formulated, and which made it a valid argument, if not for all,
at least for the most common and characteristic, kinds of property. It
is not merely that the ownership of any substantial share in the
national wealth is concentrated to-day in the hands of a few hundred
thousand families, and that at the end of an age which began with an
affirmation of the rights of property, proprietary rights are, in fact,
far from being widely distributed. Nor is it merely that what makes
property insecure to-day is not the arbitrary taxation of
unconstitutional monarchies or the privileges of an idle
<em>noblesse</em>, but the insatiable expansion and aggregation of
property itself, which menaces with absorption all property less than
the greatest, the small master, the little shopkeeper, the country bank,
and has turned the mass of mankind into a proletariat working under the
agents and for the profit of those who own.</p>
<p>The characteristic fact, which differentiates most modern property
from that of the pre-industrial age, and which turns against it the very
reasoning by which formerly it was supported, is that in modern economic
conditions ownership is not active, but passive, that to most of those
who own property to-day it is not a means of work but an instrument for
the acquisition of gain or the exercise of power, and that there is no
guarantee that gain bears any relation to service, or power to
responsibility. For property which can be regarded as a condition of the
performance of function, like the tools of the craftsman, or the holding
of the peasant, or the personal possessions which contribute to a life
of health and efficiency, forms an insignificant proportion, as far as
its value is concerned, of the property rights existing at present. In
modern industrial societies the great mass of property consists, as the
annual review of wealth passing at death reveals, neither of personal
acquisitions such as household furniture, nor of the owner’s
stock-in-trade, but of rights of various kinds, such as royalties,
ground-rents, and, above all, of course shares in industrial
undertakings, which yield an income irrespective of any personal service
rendered by their owners. Ownership and use are normally divorced. The
greater part of modern property has been attenuated to a pecuniary lien
or bond on the product of industry, which carries with it a right to
payment, but which is normally valued precisely because it relieves the
owner from any obligation to perform. a positive or constructive
function.</p>
<p>Such property may be called Passive Property, or Property for
Acquisition, for Exploitation, or for Power, to distinguish it from the
property which is actively used by its owner for the conduct of his
profession or the upkeep of his household. To the lawyer the first is,
of course, as fully property as the second. It is questionable, however,
whether economists should call it “Property” at all, and not rather, as
Mr. Hobson has suggested, “Improperty,” since it is not identical with
the rights which secure the owner the produce of his toil, but is the
opposite of them. A classification of proprietary rights based upon this
difference would be instructive. If they were arranged according to the
closeness with which they approximate to one or other of these two
extremes, it would be found that they were spread along a line
stretching from property which is obviously the payment for, and
condition of, personal services, to property which is merely a right to
payment from the services rendered by others, in fact a private tax. The
rough order which would emerge, if all details and qualifications were
omitted, might be something as follows:—</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Property in payments made for personal services.</p></li>
<li><p>Property in personal possessions necessary to health and
comfort.</p></li>
<li><p>Property in land and tools used by their owners.</p></li>
<li><p>Property in copyright and patent rights owned by authors and
inventors.</p></li>
<li><p>Property in pure interest, including much agricultural
rent.</p></li>
<li><p>Property in profits of luck and good fortune:
“quasi-rents.”</p></li>
<li><p>Property in monopoly profits.</p></li>
<li><p>Property in urban ground rents.</p></li>
<li><p>Property in royalties.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>The first four kinds of property clearly accompany, and in some sense
condition, the performance of work. The last four clearly do not. Pure
interest has some affinities with both. It is obvious that an
undertaking or a society which saves itself need not pay other persons
to save for it; it is equally obvious that, if it is to save itself and
thus avoid the creation of a class of <em>rentiers</em>, it must not use
for current consumption the whole of the wealth annually produced. Pure
interest, therefore, represents a necessary economic cost, the
equivalent of which must be borne whatever the legal arrangements under
which capital is held, and is thus unlike the property represented by
profits (other than the equivalent of salaries and payment for necessary
risks), urban ground-rents and royalties. It relieves the recipient from
personal services, and thus resembles them.</p>
<p>“Without the former,” said Siéyès, writing of the third estate and
the privileged orders, “nothing can go on; without the latter everything
would go on infinitely better.” The crucial question for any society is,
under which of each of these two broad groups of categories the greater
part (measured in value) of the proprietary rights which it maintains
are at any given moment to be found. If they fall in the first class,
creative work will be encouraged and idleness will be depressed; if they
fall in the second, the result will be the reverse. The facts vary
widely from age to age and from country to country. Nor have they ever
been fully revealed; for the lords of the jungle do not hunt by
daylight. It is probable, at least, that in the England of 1550 to 1750,
a larger proportion of the existing property consisted of land and tools
used by their owners than either in contemporary France, where feudal
dues absorbed a considerable proportion of the peasants’ income, or than
in the England of 1 800 to 1 850, where the new capitalist manufacturers
made hundreds percent, while manual workers were goaded by starvation
into ineffectual revolt. It is probable that in the nineteenth century,
thanks to the Revolution, France and England changed places, and that,
in this respect, not only Ireland, but the British Dominions resemble
the former rather than the latter. The transformation can be studied
best of all in the United States, in parts of which the population of
peasant proprietors and small masters of the early nineteenth century
was replaced in three generations by the nightmare that haunted
Jefferson—a propertyless proletariat and a capitalist plutocracy. The
abolition of the economic privileges of agrarian feudalism, which, under
the name of equality, was the driving force of the French Revolution,
and which has taken place, in one form or another, in all countries
touched by its influence, has been largely counterbalanced since 1800 by
the growth of the inequalities springing from Industrialism.</p>
<p>Of these vital developments in the facts of property, the
conventional theory of property appears hardly to have begun to take
cognizance. So far as England and America are concerned, the current
philosophy of the subject seems to have been crystallized somewhere
about the latter part of the eighteenth century, and the orator who
expounds the sanctity of property would normally express himself more
accurately, if less eloquently, by substituting for his peroration the
words, “I desire that the social organization of my country shall as far
as possible be based upon legal principles which were formulated in
England in the seventeenth century, and which were commonly thought to
be specially suitable to the economic conditions existing in the reign
of George III.” Nor is his attitude particularly culpable. The
institution of property has undergone in the last few generations a
transformation of bewildering rapidity, and the failure of thought to
keep pace with it need cause no surprise.</p>
<p>It is rarely realized, indeed, how extremely modern are those typical
forms of property in which the practical world of to-day is principally
interested. The most salient example is the share. Of all types of
property it is the commonest and most convenient. It is a title to
property stripped of almost all the encumbrances by which property used
often to be accompanied. It yields an income and can be disposed of at
will. It makes its owner heir to the wealth of countries to which he has
never travelled and a partner in enterprises of which he hardly knows
the name. To thousands of men to-day shares and property are almost
convertible terms. The share is a product of the joint-stock company,
and in England the joint-stock company began its career in the sixteenth
century. But it took nearly 300 years for the share to develop the
characteristic attributes which lend it its peculiar attractiveness
to-day. Its disentanglement from the crude contribution, sometimes in
money, sometimes in goods, to a common undertaking, in which it
originated, took place with extraordinary slowness, and it was only in
the latter half of the nineteenth century that the process was
completed.</p>
<p>The “Joint-stock” of the East India Company—to take an example from
the greatest, though not the earliest, of all corporate enterprises—had
for the greater part of a century no financial continuity.It was
subscribed afresh for every voyage, or series of voyages, and repaid
after it. It was not until 1657 that the practice of dividing capital as
well as profits was abandoned; it was not until after the Restoration
that the shares became transferable. The “Bubble” Act of 1719 tried to
put down joint-stock finance—“shares in stocks transferable or
assignable”—altogether, except in companies possessing royal or
parliamentary authorization. Well into the nineteenth century the law
continued to look with suspicion on the transferable share, as a new and
dubious form of property. Lord Ellenborough in 1808 denounced the whole
system of raising capital by means of numerous small subscriptions, and
warned the parties in a case which came before him to “forbear to carry
into operation… this mischievous project founded on joint-stock and
transferable shares.” Chief Justice Best, in 1828, objected to the
practice of assigning shares unless the company were a corporation, or a
joint-stock undertaking created by Act of Parliament. “The assignee,” he
argued, “can join in no action for a cause of action that accrued before
the assignment. Such rights of action must still remain in the assignor,
who, notwithstanding he has retired from the company, will still remain
liable for every debt contracted by the company before he ceases to be a
member. Indeed, the members of corporation cannot assign their interest
and force their assignees into the corporation without the authority of
an Act of Parliament… It concerns the public that bodies, composed of a
great number of persons, with large disposable capitals, should not be
formed without the authority of the Crown, and subject to such
regulations as the King, in his wisdom, may deem necessary for the
public security.” Even in 1837 it could be held that a joint-stock
company, with shares assignable at the will of the holder, was illegal.
Even in 1859, four years after the first general Limited Liability Act,
it was not certain that a broker who dealt in the shares of an
unincorporated company was acting lawfully.</p>
<p>The existence of this body of opinion at a time so near to our own is
significant. What it means is that, down to less than two generations
ago, the type of property which is to-day most popular and most
universal was still regarded with suspicion as a dubious innovation, to
be tolerated only in the special case of companies incorporated by Royal
Charter or by Act of Parliament. The assumption of the law and of the
business world was that, in the normal undertaking, ownership and
management were vested in the hands of the same person. Corporate
finance, based on the existence of a large body of shareholders, which
is now the rule, was then the exception. The contrast offered by that
attitude with the facts of industrial organization as they exist to-day
is an indication of the revolution in the nature of property in capital
which has taken place since the establishment of Limited Liability in
1855, and the Companies Act of 1862. In modern industrial communities
the general effect of recent economic development has been to swell
proprietary rights which entitle the owners to payment without work, and
to diminish those which can properly be described as functional. The
expansion of the former, and the process by which the simpler forms of
property have been merged in them, are movements the significance of
which it is hardly possible to over-estimate. There is still, of course,
a considerable body of property which is of the older type. But though
working landlords, and capitalists who manage their own businesses,
continue to be in the aggregate a numerous body, the organization for
which they stand is not that which is most representative of the modern
economic world.</p>
<p>The general tendency for the ownership and administration of property
to be separated, the general refinement of property into a claim on
goods produced by an unknown worker, is as unmistakable as the growth of
capitalist industry and urban civilization themselves. Villages are
turned into towns, and property in land changes from the holding worked
by a farmer or the estate administered by a landlord into “rents,” which
are advertised and bought and sold like any other investment. Mines are
opened, and the rights of the landlord are converted into a tribute for
every ton of coal which is brought to the surface. As joint-stock
companies take the place of the individual enterprise which was typical
of the earlier years of the factory system, organization passes from the
employer who both owns and manages his business, into the hands of
salaried officials, and again the mass of property-owners is swollen by
the multiplication of <em>rentiers</em> who put their wealth at the
disposal of industry, but who have no other connection with it.</p>
<p>The census of manufactures for 1914 gives a picture of the change in
the United States. It shows that 80.2% of the wage-earners were employed
by corporations, that 91.4% of the mineral products of the country were
produced under corporate direction, that in banking less than 1% of the
total resources was represented by private banks, and that the
percentage of value added by manufacture in establishments owned by
corporations increased from 63.3% in 1899 to 81.9% in 1914. For Great
Britain no equally comprehensive statistics are available. We do not
know even approximately what proportion the wage-earners employed and
the output produced by the 73,341 Companies, with a nominal capital of
£3,083,086,049, which were on the register of the Board of Trade in
1919, formed of the total workers and wealth production of the country;
nor, when the legal form is that of a limited company, is it clear to
what extent ownership is, in fact, divorced from management. It is
certain, however, that as far as all the great staple industries, except
agriculture and building, are concerned, that separation has been
carried almost as far in Great Britain as in America, and that every
year it is proceeding further.</p>
<p>The revolutionary effects of the legislation which begins with the
Companies Act of 1 844 and the Act establishing Limited Liability in
1855 have only begun, in fact, fully to reveal themselves within the
last twenty years. Its consequence has been to make the organization of
English industry in 1921 as different from that of the days of Bright
and Cobden as that of the latter was from industry in the year 1800.
They have caused the whole philosophy of individualism, which was based
on the “individual initiative” of “the employer,” to be as remote from
the realities of the modern economic world as their noble
internationalism is from its frenzied international politics.</p>
<p>Banking, in which, as the Treasury Committee on Bank Amalgamations
reported in 1918, “the number of private banks has fallen from 37 to 6
since 1891, and the number of English Joint-stock banks from 106 to 34
during the same period,” and which is, in effect the monopoly of an even
smaller number of firms than those figures would suggest, railways, with
their 300 directors, half a million shareholders and over 600,000
employees, and insurance, are given over altogether to corporate
enterprise. The 1452 mine-owners of the country, apart from a few small
firms producing an insignificant proportion of the total output, are
limited companies; the capital of £135,000,000 invested in collieries in
1914 is the “property,” and the 1,110,834 mine-workers the employees, of
37,316 (or, if industries allied with coal-mining be included, 94,723)
shareholders. In manufacturing industry a firm like Vickers Ltd., with
60,000 shareholders, is still, no doubt, the exception. But in all the
more important industries, the categories of “employer and employed” are
by now almost as archaic as those of master and servant. The division of
the industrial world into absentee shareholders, directors, salaried
managers, under-managers and technicians, and hired wage-earners, is
to-day in shipbuilding, engineering, textiles, the manufacture of
clothing, of boots and shoes and of fifty other necessaries, not the
exception, but the rule.</p>
<p>Every acceleration in the movement towards combination, which has
made such gigantic strides in the last six years, necessarily
accentuates still further the separation between property rights and
constructive work, which is the essence of this type of organization.
The change is taking place in our day most conspicuously, perhaps,
through the displacement in retail trade of the small shopkeeper by the
multiple store, and the substitution in manufacturing industry of
combines and amalgamations for separate businesses conducted by
competing employers. And, of course, it is not only by economic
development that such claims are created. “Out of the eater came forth
meat, and out of the strong came forth sweetness.” It is improbable that
war, which in barbarous ages used to be blamed as destructive of
property, has recently created more titles to property than almost all
other causes put together. As between countries, the industry of the
vanquished is subject to a mortgage in favour of the victors, which, if
it is to be discharged in goods, may yield an agreeable tribute, but
will be a doubtful blessing to those who live by labour. Within each
country, the annual output of wealth will be subject, except in the case
of repudiation or a capital levy, to a first charge in the shape of
interest, amounting in “Great Britain” to some £300,000,000, to be paid
to investors in war loans. In the absence of countervailing measures,
such as subsidies and special taxation, the effect must be to produce a
considerable redistribution of wealth, to the prejudice of those who are
dependent mainly on personal work, and to the advantage of those whose
main source of income is the ownership of property.</p>
<p>Infinitely diverse as are these proprietary rights, they have the
common characteristic of being so entirely separated from the actual
objects over which they are exercised, so rarified and generalized, as
to be analogous almost to a form of currency rather than to the property
which is so closely united to its owner as to seem almost a part of his
personality. Their isolation from the rough environment of economic
life, where the material objects of which they are the symbol are shaped
and handled, is their charm. It is also their danger. The hold which a
class has upon the future depends on the function which it performs.
What nature demands is work; few working aristocracies, however
tyrannical, have fallen; few functionless aristocracies have survived.
In society, as in the world of organic life, atrophy is but one stage
removed from death. In proportion as the landowner becomes a mere
<em>rentier</em> and industry is conducted, not by the rude energy of
the competing employers who dominated its infancy, but by the salaried
servants of shareholders, the argument for private property which
reposes on the impossibility of finding any organization to supersede
them loses its application, for they are already superseded.</p>
<p>Whatever may be the justification of these types of property, it
cannot be that which was given for the property of the peasant or the
craftsman. It cannot be that they are necessary in order to secure to
each man the fruits of his own labour. For if a legal right which gives
£50,000 a year to a mineral owner in the North of England and to a
ground landlord in London “secures the fruits of labour” at all, the
fruits are the proprietor’s and the labour that of some one else.
Property has no more insidious enemies than those well-meaning
anarchists who, by defending all forms of it as equally valid, involve
the institution in the discredit attaching to its extravagances. In
reality, whatever conclusion may be drawn from the fact, the greater
part of modern property belongs to the category of property which is
held, not for use or enjoyment, but for acquisition or power. Sometimes,
like mineral rights and urban ground-rents, it is merely a form of
private taxation which the law allows certain persons to levy on the
industry of others; sometimes, like property in capital, it consists of
rights to payment for instruments which the capitalist cannot himself
use but puts at the disposal of those who can. In either case, it has as
its essential feature that it confers upon its owners income
unaccompanied by personal service.</p>
<p>In this respect the ownership of land and the ownership of capital
are normally similar, though from other points of view their differences
are important. To the economist rent and interest are distinguished by
the fact that the latter, though it is often accompanied by surplus
elements which are merged with it in dividends, is the price of an
instrument of production which would not be forthcoming for industry if
the price were not paid, while the former is a differential surplus
which does not affect the supply. To the business community and the
solicitor land and capital are equally investments, between which, since
they possess the common characteristic of yielding income without
labour, it is inequitable to discriminate. Though their significance as
economic categories may be different, their effect as social
institutions is the same. It is to separate property from creative
activity, and to divide society into two classes, of which one has its
primary interest in passive ownership, while the other is mainly
dependent upon active work.</p>
<p>Hence the real analogy to many kinds of modern property is not the
simple property of the small landowner or the craftsman, still less the
household gods and dear domestic amenities, which is what the word
suggests to the guileless minds of clerks and shopkeepers, and which
stampede them into displaying the ferocity of terrified sheep when the
cry is raised that “Property” is threatened. It is the feudal dues which
robbed the French peasant of part of his produce till the Revolution
abolished them. How do royalties differ from <em>quintaines</em> and
<em>lods et ventes</em>? They are similar in their origin and similar in
being a tax levied on each increment of wealth which labour produces.
How do urban ground-rents differ from the payments which were made to
English sinecurists before the Reform Bill of 1832? They are equally
tribute paid by those who work to those who do not. If the monopoly
profits of the owner of <em>banalités</em>, whose tenant must grind corn
at his mill and make wine at his press, were an intolerable oppression,
what is the sanctity attaching to the monopoly profits of the
capitalists, who, as the Report of the Government Committee on trusts
tells us, “in soap, tobacco, wall-paper, salt, cement and in the textile
trades… are in a position to control output and prices,” or, in other
words, can compel the consumer to buy from them, at the figure they fix,
on pain of not buying at all?</p>
<p>All these rights—royalties, ground-rents, monopoly profits, surpluses
of all kinds—are “Property.” The criticism most fatal to them is not
that of Socialists. It is contained in the arguments by which property
is usually defended. The meaning of the institution, it is said, is to
encourage industry by securing that the worker shall receive the produce
of his toil. But then, precisely in proportion as it is important to
preserve the property which a man has in the results of his own labour,
is it important to abolish that which he has in the results of the
labour of some one else. If the former “turns sand into gold,” the
latter turns gold into sand; for it saps the motives for constructive
effort. The considerations which justify ownership as a function are
those which condemn it as a tax. Property is not theft, but a good deal
of theft becomes property. The owner of royalties who, when asked why he
should be paid £50,000 a year from minerals which he has neither
discovered nor developed nor worked but only owned, replies “But it’s
Property!” may feel all the awe which his language suggests. But in
reality he is behaving like the snake which sinks into its background by
pretending that it is the dead branch of a tree, or the lunatic who
tried to catch rabbits by sitting behind a hedge and making a noise like
a turnip. He is practising protective—and sometimes aggressive—mimicry.
His sentiments about property are those of the simple toiler who fears
that what he has sown another may reap. His claim is to be allowed to
continue to reap what another has sown.</p>
<p>It is sometimes suggested that the less attractive characteristics of
our industrial civilization, its combination of luxury and squalor, its
class divisions and class warfare, are accidental maladjustments which
are not rooted in the centre of its being, but are excrescences which
economic progress itself may in time be expected to correct. That
agreeable optimism will not survive an examination of the operation of
the institution of private property in land and capital in
industrialized communities. In countries where land is widely
distributed, in France or in Ireland, its effect may be to produce a
general diffusion of wealth among a rural middle class who at once work
and own. In countries where the development of industrial organization
has separated the ownership of property and the performance of work, the
normal effect of private property is to transfer to functionless owners
the surplus arising from the more valuable sites, the better machinery,
the more elaborate organization.</p>
<p>No clearer exemplification of the operation of this “law of rent” has
been given than the figures supplied to the Coal Industry Commission by
Sir Arthur Lowes Dickenson, which showed that in a given quarter the
costs per ton of producing coal varied from 12s. 6d. to 48s. 0d. per
ton, and the profits from <em>nil</em> to 16s. 6d. The distribution in
dividends to shareholders of the surplus accruing from the working of
richer and more accessible seams, from special opportunities and access
to markets, from superior machinery, management and organization,
involves the establishment of Privilege as a national institution, as
much as the most arbitrary exactions of a feudal <em>seigneur</em>. It
is the foundation of an inequality which is not accidental or temporary,
but necessary and permanent. And on this inequality is erected the whole
apparatus of class institutions, which make not only the income, but the
housing, education, health and manners, indeed the very physical
appearance, of different classes of Englishmen almost as different from
each other as though the minority were alien settlers established amid
the rude civilization of a race of impoverished aborigines.</p>

<section id="c-property-and-security" class="level2">
<h2>(c) Property and Security</h2>
<p>So the justification of private property traditional in England,
which saw in it the security that each man would enjoy the fruits of his
own labour, though largely applicable to the age in which it was
formulated, has undergone the fate of most political theories. It has
been refuted not by the doctrines of rival philosophers, but by the
prosaic course of economic development. As far as the mass of mankind
are concerned, the need which private property other than personal
possessions does still often satisfy, though imperfectly and
precariously, is the need for security. To the small investors, who are
the majority of property owners, though owning only an insignificant
fraction of the property in existence, its meaning is simple. It is not
wealth or power, or even leisure from work. It is safety. They work
hard. They save a little money for old age, or for sickness, or for
their children. They invest it, and the interest stands between them and
all that they dread most. Their savings are of convenience to industry,
the income from them is convenient to themselves. “Why,” they ask,
“should we not reap in old age the advantage of energy and thrift in
youth?” And this hunger for security is so imperious that those who
suffer most from the abuses of property, as well as those who, if they
could profit by them, would be least inclined to do so, will tolerate
and even defend them, for fear lest the knife which trims dead matter
should cut into the quick. They have seen too many men drown to be
critical of dry land, though it be an inhospitable rock. They are
haunted by the nightmare of the future, and, if a burglar broke it,
would welcome a burglar.</p>
<p>This need for security is fundamental, and almost the gravest
indictment of our civilization is that the mass of mankind are without
it. Property is one way of organizing it. It is quite comprehensible
therefore, that the instrument should be confused with the end, and that
any proposal to modify it should create dismay. In the past, human
beings, roads, bridges and ferries, civil, judicial and clerical
offices, and commissions in the army have all been private property.
Whenever it was proposed to abolish the rights exercised over them, it
was protested that their removal would involve the destruction of an
institution in which thrifty men had invested their savings, and on
which they depended for protection amid the chances of life and for
comfort in old age.</p>
<p>In fact, however, property is not the only method of assuring the
future, nor, when it is the way selected, is security dependent upon the
maintenance of all the rights which are at present normally involved in
ownership. In so far as its psychological foundation is the necessity
for securing an income which is stable and certain, which is forthcoming
when its recipient cannot work, and which can be used to provide for
those who cannot provide for themselves, what is really demanded is not
the command over the fluctuating proceeds of some particular
undertaking, which accompanies the ownership of capital, but the
security which is offered by an annuity. Property is the instrument,
security is the object, and when some alternative way is forthcoming of
providing the latter, it does not appear in practice that any loss of
confidence, of freedom or of independence is caused by the absence of
the former.</p>
<p>Hence not only the manual workers, who since the rise of capitalism,
have rarely in England been able to accumulate property sufficient to
act as a guarantee of income when their period of active earning is
past, but also the middle and professional classes, increasingly seek
security to-day, not in investment, but in insurance against sickness
and death, in the purchase of annuities, or in what is in effect the
same thing, the accumulation of part of their salary towards a pension
which is paid when their salary ceases. The professional man may buy
shares in the hope of making a profit on the transaction. But when what
he desires to buy is security, the form which his investment takes is
usually some kind of insurance. The teacher, or nurse, or government
servant looks forward to a pension. Women, who fifty years ago would
have been regarded as dependent almost as completely as if femininity
were an incurable disease with which they had been born, and whose
fathers, unless rich men, would have been tormented with anxiety for
fear lest they should not save sufficient to provide for them, now
receive an education, support themselves in professions, and save in the
same way.</p>
<p>The amount spent to-day on insurance alone is the more remarkable in
view of the comparatively recent period, hardly more than two centuries,
within which this type of provision has developed. The total annual
expenditure in the United Kingdom on premiums is already over
£50,000,000, the amount insured some £1,200,000,000, and the aggregate
policies in force over 38,000,000. It is true that a large number of
these policies lapse, and that, while the amount insured (almost
entirely by the well-to-do classes) in the “ordinary” branch of
insurance is some £870,000,000, the working classes, with only
£363,000,000 to their credit in the “industrial” branch, are miserably
under-insured. Even to-day it is still the case that almost all
wage-earners outside government employment, and many in it, as well as
large numbers of professional men, have nothing to fall back upon in
sickness or old age. But that does not alter the fact that, when it is
made, this type of provision meets the need for security, which, apart,
of course, from personal possessions and household furniture, is the
principal meaning of property to by far the largest element in the
population, and that it meets it more completely and certainly than
property itself.</p>
<p>Nor, indeed, even when property is the instrument used to provide for
the future, is such provision dependent upon the maintenance in its
entirety of the whole body of rights which accompany ownership to-day.
Property is not simple but complex. That of a man who has invested his
savings as an ordinary shareholder comprises at least three rights, the
right to interest, the right to profits, and (in legal theory) the right
to control. In so far as what is desired is the guarantee for the
maintenance of a stable income, not the acquisition of additional wealth
without labour—in so far as his motive is not gain but security—the need
is met by interest on capital. It has no necessary connection either
with the right to residuary profits or the right to control the
management of the undertaking from which the profits are derived, both
of which are vested to-day in the shareholder. If all that were desired
were to use property as an instrument for purchasing security, the
obvious course—from the point of view of the investor desiring to insure
his future the safest course—would be to assimilate his position as far
as possible to that of a debenture holder or mortgagee, who obtains the
stable income which is his motive for investment, but who neither incurs
the risks nor receives the profits of the speculator.</p>
<p>The elaborate apparatus of proprietary rights which distributes
dividends of 30% to the shareholders in Coats, and several thousands a
year to the owner of mineral royalties and ground-rents, and then allows
them to transmit the bulk of gains which they have not earned to
descendants who in their turn will thus be relieved from the necessity
of earning, is property run mad. To insist that it must be maintained
for the sake of the widow and the orphan, the vast majority of whom have
neither and would gladly part with them all for a safe annuity if they
had, is, to say the least of it, extravagantly <em>mal-a-propos</em>. It
is like pitching a man into the water because he expresses a wish for a
bath, or presenting a tiger cub to a householder who is plagued with
mice, on the ground that tigers and cats both belong to the genus
<em>felis</em>. The tiger hunts for itself not for its masters, and when
game is scarce will hunt them. The classes who own little or no property
may reverence it because it is security. But the classes who own much
prize it or quite different reasons, and laugh in their sleeve at the
innocence which supposes that anything so vulgar as the savings of the
<em>petite bourgeoisie</em> have, except at elections, any interest for
them. They prize it because it is the order which quarters them on the
community and which provides for the maintenance of a leisure class at
the public expense.</p>

<section id="d-the-tyranny-of-functionless-property" class="level2">
<h2>(d) The Tyranny of Functionless Property</h2>
<p>“Possession,” said the Egoist, “without obligation to the object
possessed, approaches felicity.” Functionless property appears natural
to those who believe that society should be organized for the
acquisition of private wealth, and attacks upon it perverse or
malicious, because the question which such persons ask of any
institution is, “What does it yield?” And such property yields much to
those who own it. Those, however, who hold that social unity and
effective work are possible only if society is organized and wealth
distributed on the basis of function, will ask of an institution, not,
“What dividends does it pay?” but “What service does it perform?” To
them the fact that much property yields income irrespective of any
service which is performed or obligation which is recognized by its
owners will appear, not a quality, but a vice. They will see in the
social confusion which it produces, payments disproportionate to service
here, and payments without any service at all there, and dissatisfaction
everywhere, a convincing confirmation of their argument that to build on
a foundation of rights and of rights alone is to build on a
quicksand.</p>
<p>From this portentous exaggeration into an absolute of what once was,
and still might be, a sane and social institution most other evils
follow. Its fruits are the power of those who do not work over those who
do, the alternate subservience and rebelliousness of those who work
towards those who do not, the starving of science and thought and
creative effort for fear that expenditure upon them should impinge on
the comfort of the sluggard and the <em>fainéant</em>, and the
arrangement of society in most of its subsidiary activities to suit the
convenience, not of those who work usefully, but of those who spend
gaily; so that the most hideous, desolate and parsimonious places in the
country are those in which the greatest wealth is produced, the Clyde
valley, or the cotton towns of Lancashire, or the mining villages of
Scotland and Wales, and the gayest and most luxurious those in which it
is consumed. From the point of view of social health and economic
efficiency, society should obtain its material equipment at the cheapest
price possible, and, after providing for depreciation and expansion,
should distribute the whole product to its working members and their
dependents. What happens at present, however, is that its workers are
hired at the cheapest price which the market (as modified by
organization) allows, and that the surplus, somewhat diminished by
taxation, is distributed to the owners of property.</p>
<p>Profits may vary in a given year from a loss to 100%. But wages are
fixed at a level which will enable the marginal firm to continue
producing one year with another; and the surplus, even when due partly
to efficient management, goes neither to managers nor to manual workers,
but to shareholders. The meaning of the process becomes startlingly
apparent when, as recently in Lancashire, large blocks of capital change
hands at a period of abnormal activity. The existing shareholders
receive the equivalent of the capitalized expectation of future profits.
The workers, as workers, do not participate in the immense increment in
value. And when, in the future, they demand an advance in wages, they
will be met by the answer that profits, which before the transaction
would have been reckoned large, yield shareholders after it only a low
rate of interest on their investment.</p>
<p>The truth is that, whereas in earlier ages the protection of property
was normally the protection of work, the relationship between them has
come in the course of the economic development of the last two centuries
to be very nearly reversed. The two elements which compose civilization
are active efforts and passive property, the labour of human things and
the tools which human beings use. Of these two elements those who supply
the first maintain and improve it, those who own the second normally
dictate its character, its development and its administration. Hence,
though politically free, the mass of mankind live in effect under rules
imposed to protect the interests of the small section among them whose
primary concern is ownership. From this subordination of creative
activity to passive property, the worker who depends upon his brains,
the organizer, inventor, teacher or doctor suffers almost as much
embarrassment as the craftsman. The real economic cleavage is not, as is
often said, between employers and employed, but between all who do
constructive work, from scientist to labourer, on the one hand, and all
whose main interest is the preservation of existing proprietary rights
upon the other, irrespective of whether they contribute to constructive
work or not.</p>
<p>If, therefore, under the modern conditions which have concentrated
any substantial share of property in the hands of a small minority of
the population, the world is to be governed for the advantage of those
who own, it is only incidentally and by accident that the results will
be agreeable to those who work. In practice there is a constant
collision between them. Turned into another channel, half the wealth
distributed in dividends to function less shareholders, could secure
every child a good education up to 18, could re-endow English
Universities, and (since more efficient production is important) could
equip English industries for more efficient production. Half the
ingenuity now applied to the protection of property could have made most
industrial diseases as rare as smallpox, and most English cities into
places of health and even of beauty. What stands in the way is the
doctrine that the rights of property are absolute, irrespective of any
social function which its owners may perform. So the laws which are most
stringently enforced are still the laws which protect property, though
the protection of property is no longer likely to be equivalent to the
protection of work, and the interests which govern industry and
predominate in public affairs are proprietary interests.</p>
<p>A mill-owner may poison or mangle a generation of operatives; but his
brother magistrates will let him off with a caution or a nominal fine to
poison and mangle the next. For he is an owner of property. A landowner
may draw rents from slums in which young children die at the rate of 200
per 1000; but he will be none the less welcome in polite society. For
property has no obligations and therefore can do no wrong. Urban land
may be held from the market on the outskirts of cities in which human
beings are living three to a room, and rural land may be used for sport
when villagers are leaving it to overcrowd them still more. No public
authority intervenes, for both are property.</p>
<p>Nor are these practical evils the gravest consequences which flow
from the hypertrophy of property in an industrial society. Property is
in its nature a kind of limited sovereignty. Its essence is a power,
secured by the State to some individual or group as against all others,
to dispose of the objects over which the proprietary rights are
exercised. When those objects are simple and easily obtained, the
property is normally harmless or beneficial. When they are such that,
while they can be acquired only by the few, the mass of mankind cannot
live unless it has free access to them, their proprietors, in
prescribing their use, may become the irresponsible governors of
thousands of other human beings.</p>
<p>Hence, when pushed to extremes, applied to purposes for which it was
not designed, and in an environment to which it is not adapted, property
in things swells into something which is, in effect, sovereignty over
persons. “The main objection to a large corporation,” writes Mr. Justice
Brandeis, of the Supreme Court of the U.S.A., “is that it makes
possible—and in many cases makes inevitable—the exercise of industrial
absolutism.” In England such absolutism is felt mainly in the hours of
work, above all in the power to deprive the wage-earner of his
livelihood by dismissing him from his employment. In America there are
cities where the company owns not only the works, but halls and
meeting-places, streets and pavements, where the town council and police
are its nominees, and the pulpit and press its mouthpieces, where no
meeting can be held to which it objects and no citizen can dwell of whom
it disapproves.Such property confers a private franchise or jurisdiction
analogous to that which in some periods has been associated with the
ownership of land. The men who endure it may possess as citizens the
right to “life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.” But they live,
in effect, at the will of a lord.</p>
<p>To those who believe that institutions which repudiate all moral
significance must sooner or later collapse, a society which confuses the
protection of property with the preservation of its functionless
perversions will appear as precarious as that which has left the
memorials of its tasteless frivolity and more tasteless ostentation in
the gardens of Versailles. Do men love peace? They will see the greatest
enemy of social unity in rights which involve no obligation to
co-operate for the service of society. Do they value equality? Property
rights which dispense their owners from the common human necessity of
labour make inequality an institution permeating every corner of
society, from the distribution of material wealth to the training of
intellect itself. Do they desire greater industrial efficiency? There is
no more fatal obstacle to efficiency than the revelation that idleness
has the same privileges as industry, and that for every additional blow
with the pick or hammer an additional profit will be distributed among
shareholders who wield neither.</p>
<p>Indeed, functionless property is the greatest enemy of legitimate
property itself. It is the parasite which kills the organism that
produced it. Bad money drives out good, and, as the history of the last
two hundred years shows, when property for acquisition or power and
property for service or for use jostle each other freely in the market,
without restrictions such as some legal systems have imposed on
alienation and inheritance, the latter tends normally to be absorbed by
the former, because it has less resisting power. Thus functionless
property grows, and as it grows it undermines the creative energy which
produced the institution of property and which in earlier ages property
protected. It cannot unite men, for what unites them is the bond of
service to a common purpose, and that bond it repudiates, since its very
essence is the maintenance of rights irrespective of service. It cannot
create; it can only spend, so that the number of scientists, inventors,
artists or men of letters who have sprung in the course of the last
century from hereditary riches can be numbered on one hand. It values
neither culture nor beauty, but only the power which belongs to wealth
and the ostentation which is the symbol of it.</p>
<p>So those who dread these qualities, energy and thought and the
creative spirit—and they are many—will not discriminate, as we have
tried to discriminate, between different types and kinds of property, in
order that they may preserve those which are legitimate and abolish
those which are not. They will endeavour to preserve all private
property, even in its most degenerate forms. And those who value those
things will try to promote them by relieving property of its
perversions, and thus enabling it to return to its true nature.</p>
<p>They will not desire to establish any visionary communism, for they
will realize that the free disposal of a sufficiency of personal
possessions is the condition of a healthy and self-respecting life, and
will seek to distribute more widely the property rights which make them
to-day the privilege of a minority. But they will refuse to submit to
the naive philosophy which would treat all proprietary rights as equal
in sanctity merely because they are identical in name. They will
distinguish sharply between property which is used by its owner for the
conduct of his profession or the upkeep of his household, and property
which is merely a claim on wealth produced by another’s labour. They
will insist that property is moral and healthy only when it is used as a
condition, not of idleness, but of activity, and when it involves the
discharge of definite personal obligations. They will endeavour in
short, to base it upon the principle of function.</p>

</section>
<section id="the-functional-society" class="level1">
<h1>The Functional Society</h1>
<p>The application to property and industry of the principle of function
is compatible with several different types of social organization, and
is as unlikely as more important revelations to be the secret of those
who cry “Lo here!” and “Lo there!” What it means, in effect, is that
society should be organized primarily for the performance of
<em>duties</em>, not for the maintenance of <em>rights</em>, and that
the rights which it protects should be those which are necessary to the
discharge of social obligations. But duties, unlike rights, are relative
to some end or purpose, for the sake of which they are imposed. The
latter are a principle of division; they enable men to resist. The
former are a principle of union; they lead men to co-operate. The
essential thing, therefore, is that men should fix their minds upon the
idea of purpose, and give that idea pre-eminence over all subsidiary
issues.</p>
<p>If, as is patent, the purpose of industry is to provide the material
foundations of a good social life, then any measure which makes that
provision more effective, so long as it does not conflict with some
still more important purpose, is wise, and any institution which thwarts
or encumbers it is foolish. It is foolish, for example, to maintain
property rights for which no service is performed, for payment without
service is waste; and if it is true, as statisticians affirm, that, even
were income equally divided, income per head would be small, then it is
all the more foolish. Sailors in a boat have no room for first-class
passengers, and, the smaller the total national income, the more
important is it that none of it should be misapplied. It is foolish to
leave the direction of industry in the hands of the servants of private
property-owners, who themselves know nothing about it but its balance
sheets, because this is to divert it from the performance of service to
the acquisition of gain, and to subordinate those who do creative work
to those who do not.</p>
<p>It is foolish, above all, to cripple education, as it is crippled in
England for the sake of industry; for one of the uses of industry is to
provide the wealth which may make possible better education. If a
society with the sense to keep means and ends in their proper places did
no more than secure the investment in the education of children of a
fraction of the wealth which to-day is applied to the production of
futilities, it would do more for posterity—it would in a strictly
economic sense, “save” more “capital”—than the most parsimonious of
communities which ever lived with its eyes on the Stock Exchange. To one
who thinks calmly over the recent experience of mankind there is
something almost unbearable in the reflection that hitherto, outside a
small circle of fortunate families, each generation, as its faculties
began to flower, has been shovelled like raw material into an economic
mill, to be pounded and ground and kneaded into the malleable human pulp
out of which national prosperity and power, all the kingdoms of the
world and the glory of them, are supposed to be manufactured. In England
a new race of nearly 900,000 souls bursts upon us every year; and if,
instead of rejuvenating the world, they grind corn for the Philistines
and doff bobbins for mill-owners, the responsibility is ours into whose
hands the prodigality of nature pours life itself, and who let it slip
aimlessly through the fingers that close so greedily on material
riches.</p>
<p>The course of wisdom in the affairs of industry is, after all, what
it is in any other department of organized life. It is to consider the
end for which economic activity is carried on and then to adapt economic
organization to it. It is to pay for service and for service only, and
when capital is hired to make sure that it is hired at the cheapest
possible price. It is to place the responsibility for organizing
industry on the shoulders of those who work and use, not of those who
own, because production is the business of the producer and the proper
person to see that he discharges his business is the consumer, for whom,
and not for the owner of property, it ought to be carried on. Above all
it is to insist that all industries shall be conducted in complete
publicity as to costs and profits, because publicity ought to be the
antiseptic both of economic and political abuses, and no man can have
confidence in his neighbour unless both work in the light.</p>
<p>As far as property is concerned, such a policy would possess two
edges. On the one hand, it would aim at abolishing those forms of
property in which ownership is divorced from obligations. On the other
hand, it would seek to encourage those forms of economic organization
under which the worker, whether owner or not, is free to carry on his
work without sharing its control or its profits with the mere
<em>rentier</em>. Thus, if in certain spheres it involved an extension
of public ownership, it would in others foster an extension of private
property. For it is not private ownership, but private ownership
divorced from work, which is corrupting to the principle of industry;
and the idea of some socialists that private property in land or capital
is necessarily mischievous is a piece of scholastic pedantry as absurd
as that of those conservatives who would invest all property with some
kind of mysterious sanctity. It all depends what sort of property it is
and for what purpose it is used. The State can retain its eminent
domain, and control alienation, as it does under the Homestead laws of
the Dominions, with sufficient stringency to prevent the creation of a
class of functionless property-owners. In that case there is no
inconsistency between encouraging simultaneously a multiplication of
peasant farmers and small masters who own their own farms or shops, and
the abolition of private ownership in those industries, unfortunately
to-day the most conspicuous, in which the private owner is an absentee
shareholder.</p>
<p>Indeed, the second reform would help the first. In so far as the
community tolerates functionless property, it makes difficult, if not
impossible, the restoration of the small master in agriculture or in
industry, who cannot easily hold his own in a world dominated by great
estates or capitalist finance. In so far as it abolishes those kinds of
property which are merely parasitic, it facilitates the restoration of
the small property-owners in those kinds of industry for which small
ownership is adapted. A socialistic policy towards the former is not
antagonistic to the “distributive state,” but, in modern economic
conditions, a necessary preliminary to it; and if by “Property” is meant
the personal possessions which the word suggests to nine-tenths of the
population, the object of socialists is not to undermine property but to
protect and increase it.</p>
<p>The boundary between large scale and small scale production will
always be uncertain and fluctuating, depending, as it does, on technical
conditions which cannot be foreseen: a cheapening of electrical power,
for example, might result in the decentralization of manufactures, as
steam resulted in their concentration. The fundamental issue, however,
is not between different scales of ownership, but between ownership of
different kinds, not between the large farmer or master and the small,
but between property which is used for work and property which yields
income without it. The Irish landlord was abolished, not because he
owned upon a large scale, but because he was an owner and nothing more;
if and when English landownership has been equally attenuated, as in
towns it already has been, it will deserve to meet the same fate. Once
the issue of the character of ownership has been settled, the question
of the size of the economic unit can be left to settle itself.</p>
<p>The first step, then, towards the organization of economic life for
the performance of function is to abolish those types of private
property in return for which no function is performed. The man who lives
by owning without working is necessarily supported by the industry of
some one else, and is, therefore, too expensive a luxury to be
encouraged. Though he deserves to be treated with the leniency which
ought to be, and usually is not, shown to those who have been brought up
from infancy to any other disreputable trade, indulgence to individuals
must not condone the institution of which both they and their neighbours
are the victims. Judged by this standard, certain kinds of property are
obviously anti-social. The rights in virtue of which the owner of land
is entitled to levy a tax, called a royalty, on every ton of coal which
the miner brings to the surface, to levy another tax, called a
way-leave, on every ton of coal transported under the surface of his
land though its amenity and value may be quite unaffected, to distort,
if he pleases, the development of a whole district by refusing access to
the minerals except upon his own terms, and to cause some 3,500 to 4,000
million tons to be wasted in barriers between different properties,
while he in the meantime contributes to a chorus of lamentations over
the wickedness of the miners in not producing more tons of coal for the
public and incidentally more private taxes for himself—all this adds an
agreeable touch of humour to the drab quality of our industrial
civilization, for which mineral owners deserve, perhaps, some
recognition, but not the £100,000 a year odd which is paid to each of
the four leading players, or the £6,000,000 a year which is distributed
among the crowd.</p>
<p>The alchemy by which a gentleman who has never seen a coal mine
distils the contents of that place of gloom into elegant chambers in
London and a house in the country is not the monopoly of royalty owners.
A similar feat of prestidigitation is performed by the owner of urban
ground-rents. In rural districts some landlords, perhaps many landlords,
are partners in the hazardous and difficult business of agriculture,
and, though they may often exercise a power which is socially excessive,
the position which they hold and the income which they receive are, in
part at least, a return for the functions which they perform. The
ownership of urban land has been refined till of that crude ore only the
pure gold is left. It is the perfect sinecure, for the only function it
involves is that of collecting its rents, and in an age when the
struggle of Liberalism against sinecures was still sufficiently recent
to stir some chords of memory, the last and the greatest of liberal
thinkers drew the obvious deduction. “The reasons which form the
justification… of property in land,” wrote Mill in 1848, “are valid only
in so far as the proprietor of land is its improver… In no sound theory
of private property was it ever contemplated that the proprietor of land
should be merely a sinecurist quartered on it.”</p>
<p>Urban ground-rents and royalties are, in fact, as the Prime Minister
in his unregenerate days suggested, a tax which some persons are
permitted by the law to levy upon the industry of others. They differ
from public taxation only in that their amount increases in proportion,
not to the nation’s need of revenue, but to its need of the coal and
space on which they are levied, that their growth inures to private gain
not to public benefit, and that, if the proceeds are wasted on frivolous
expenditure, no one has any right to complain, because the arrangement
by which Lord Smithson spends the wealth produced by Mr. Brown on
objects which do no good to either is part of the system which, under
the name of private property, Mr. Brown as well as Lord Smithson have
been taught to regard as essential to the higher welfare of mankind.</p>
<p>But if we accept the principle of function we shall ask what is the
<em>purpose</em> of this arrangement, and for what <em>end</em> the
inhabitants of, for example, London pay£16,000,000 a year to their
ground landlords. And if we find that it is for no purpose and no end,
but that these things are like the horseshoes and nails which the City
of London presents to the Crown on account of land in the Parish of
St. Clement Danes, then we shall not deal harshly with a quaint
historical survival, but neither shall we allow it to distract us from
the business of the present, as though there had been history but there
were not history any longer. We shall close these channels through which
wealth leaks away by resuming the ownership of minerals and of urban
land, as some communities in the British Dominions and on the Continent
of Europe have resumed it already. We shall secure that such large
accumulations as remain change hands at least once in every generation,
by increasing our taxes on inheritance till what passes to the heir is
little more than personal possessions, not the right to a tribute from
industry which, though qualified by death-duties, is what the son of a
rich man inherits to-day. We shall, in short, treat mineral owners and
absentee landowners as Plato would have treated the poets, whom, in
their ability to make something out of nothing and to bewitch mankind
with words, they a little resemble, and crown them with flowers and
usher them politely out of the State.</p>

<h1>The Liberation of Industry</h1>
<p>Rights without functions are like the shades in Homer, which drank
blood but scattered trembling at the voice of a man. To extinguish
royalties and urban ground-rents is merely to explode a superstition. It
needs as little—and as much—resolution as to put one’s hand through any
other ghost. In all industries except the diminishing number in which
the capitalist is himself the manager, property in capital is almost
equally passive.</p>
<p>Almost, but not quite. For, though the majority of its owners do not
themselves exercise any positive function, they appoint those who do. It
is true, of course, that the question of how capital is to be owned is
distinct from the question of how it is to be administered, and that the
former can be settled without prejudice to the latter. Shareholders own
capital which is indispensable to industry, but it does not therefore
follow that industry is dependent upon the maintenance of capital in the
hands of shareholders. To write, with some economists, as though, if
private property in capital were further attenuated or abolished
altogether, the constructive energy of the managers who may own capital
or may not, but who rarely, in the more important industries, own more
than a small fraction of it, must necessarily be impaired, is to be
guilty of a robust non-sequitur and to ignore the most obvious facts of
contemporary industry. The less the mere capitalist talks about the
necessity for the consumer of an efficient organization of industry, the
better; for, whatever the future of industry may be, an efficient
organization is likely to have no room for <em>him</em>. But though
shareholders do not govern, they reign, at least to the extent of saying
once a year “<em>le roy le veult.</em>” If their rights are pared down
or extinguished, the necessity for some organ to exercise them will
still remain. And the question of the ownership of capital has this much
in common with the question of industrial organization, that the problem
of the constitution under which industry is to be conducted is common to
both.</p>
<section id="a-industry-as-a-profession" class="level2">
<h2>(a) Industry as a Profession</h2>
<p>That constitution must be sought by considering how industry can be
organized to express most perfectly the principle of purpose. The
application to industry of the principle of purpose is simple, however
difficult it may be to give effect to it. It is to turn it into a
Profession. A Profession may be defined most simply as a trade which is
organized, incompletely, no doubt, but genuinely, for the performance of
function. It is not simply a collection of individuals who get a living
for themselves by the same kind of work. Nor is it merely a group which
is organized exclusively for the economic protection of its members,
though that is normally among its purposes. It is a body of men who
carry on their work in accordance with rules designed to enforce certain
standards both for the better protection of its members and for the
better service of the public.</p>
<p>The standard which it maintains may be high or low: all professions
have some rules which protect the interests of the community and others
which are an imposition on it. Its essence is that it assumes certain
responsibilities for the competence of its members or the quality of its
wares, and that it deliberately prohibits certain kinds of conduct on
the ground that, though they may be profitable to the individual, they
are calculated to bring into disrepute the organization to which he
belongs. While some of its rules are trade union regulations designed
primarily to prevent the economic standards of the profession being
lowered by unscrupulous competition, others have as their main object to
secure that no member of the profession shall have any but a purely
professional interest in his work, by excluding the incentive of
speculative profit. Business men may cajole the public from every
hoarding. But doctors, architects, consulting engineers, and even
lawyers are prohibited by their professional associations from
advertising, from having any pecuniary interest in the treatment or
course of action recommended to their clients, or from receiving
commissions. The fees which the more eminent among them charge for their
professional services may often be excessive. But they may charge for
professional services and for nothing else.</p>
<p>The conception implied in the words “unprofessional conduct” is,
therefore, the exact opposite of the theory and practice which assume
that the service of the public is best secured by the unrestricted
pursuit on the part of rival traders of their pecuniary self-interest,
within such limits as the law allows. It is significant that at the time
when the professional classes had deified free competition as the
arbiter of commerce and industry, they did not dream of applying it to
the occupations in which they themselves were primarily interested, but
maintained, and indeed, elaborated, machinery through which a
professional conscience might find expression. The rules themselves may
sometimes appear to the layman arbitrary and ill-conceived. But their
object is clear. It is to impose on the profession itself the obligation
of maintaining the quality of the service, and to prevent its common
purpose being frustrated through the undue influence of the motive of
pecuniary gain upon the necessities or cupidity of the individual.</p>
<p>The difference between industry as it exists today and a profession
is, then, simple and unmistakable. The former is organized for the
protection of <em>rights</em>, mainly rights to pecuniary gain, The
latter is organized, imperfectly indeed, but none the less genuinely,
for the performance of <em>duties</em>. The essence of the one is that
its only criterion is the financial return which it offers to its
shareholders. The essence of the other, is that, though men enter it for
the sake of livelihood, the measures of their success is the service
which they perform, not the gains which they amass. They may, as in the
case of a successful doctor, grow rich; but the meaning of their
profession, both for themselves and for the public, is not that they
make money but that they make health, or safety, or knowledge, or good
government or good law. They depend on it for their income, but they do
not consider that any conduct which increases their income is on that
account right. And while a boot-manufacturer who retires with half a
million is counted to have achieved success, whether the boots which he
made were of leather or brown paper, a civil servant who did the same
would, very properly, be prosecuted.</p>
<p>So, if men are doctors, they recognize that there are certain kinds
of conduct which cannot be practised, however large the fee offered for
them, because they are unprofessional; if scholars and teachers, that it
is wrong to make money by deliberately deceiving the public, as is done
by makers of patent medicines, however much the public may clamour to be
deceived; if judges or public servants, that they must not increase
their incomes by selling justice for money; if soldiers, that the
service comes first, and their private inclinations, even the reasonable
preference of life to death, second. Every country has its traitors,
every army its deserters, and every profession its blacklegs. To
idealize the professional spirit would be very absurd; is has its sordid
side, and, if it is to be fostered in industry, safeguards will be
needed to check its excesses. Clearly, a profession should not have the
final voice in deciding the charge to be made for its services. It ought
not by itself to determine the conditions on which new members are to be
admitted. It should not have so exclusive a control even of its own
technique as to be in a position to meet proposals for improvement with
the determined obstructiveness which the legal profession has offered,
for example, to the registration of land. But there is all the
difference between maintaining a standard which is occasionally
abandoned, and affirming as the central truth of existence that there is
no standard to maintain. The meaning of a profession is that it makes
the traitors the exception, not, as they tend to be in industry, the
rule. It makes them the exception by upholding as the criterion of
success the end for which the profession, whatever it may be, is carried
on, and subordinating the inclinations, appetites and ambitions of
individuals to the rules of an organization which has as its object to
promote the performance of function.</p>
<p>There is no sharp line between the professions and the industries. A
hundred years ago the trade of teaching, which to-day is on the whole an
honourable public service, was rather a vulgar speculation upon public
credulity; if Mr. Squeers was a caricature, the Oxford of Gibbon and
Adam Smith was a solid port-fed reality; no local authority could have
performed one-tenth of the duties which are carried out by a modern
municipal corporation every day, because there was no body of public
servants to perform them, and such as there were took bribes. It is
conceivable, at least, that some branches of medicine might have
developed on the lines of industrial capitalism, with hospitals as
factories, doctors hired at competitive wages as their “hands,” large
dividends paid to shareholders by catering for the rich, and the poor,
who do not offer a profitable market, supplied with an inferior service
or with no service at all.</p>
<p>The idea that there is some mysterious difference between making
munitions of war and firing them,, between building schools and teaching
in them when built, between providing food and providing health, which
makes it at once inevitable and laudable that the former should be
carried on with a single eye to pecuniary gain, while the latter are
conducted by professional men, who expect to be paid for their services,
but who neither watch for windfalls nor raise their fees merely because
there are more sick to be cured, more children to be taught, or more
enemies to be resisted, is an illusion only less astonishing than that
the leaders of industry should welcome the insult as an honour and wear
their humiliation as a kind of halo. The work of making boots or
building a house is in itself no more degrading than that of curing the
sick or teaching the ignorant. It is as necessary and therefore as
honourable. It should be at least equally bound by rules which have as
their object to maintain the standards of professional service. It
should be at least equally free from the vulgar subordination of moral
standards to financial interests.</p>
<p>If industry is to be organized as a profession, two changes are
requisite, one negative and one positive. The first, is that it should
cease to be conducted by the agents of property-owners for the advantage
of property-owners, and should be carried on, instead, for the service
of the public. The second, is that, subject to rigorous public
supervision, the responsibility for the maintenance of the service
should rest upon the shoulders of those, from organizer and scientist to
labourer, by whom, in effect, the work is conducted.</p>
<p>The first change is necessary because the conduct of industry for the
public advantage is impossible as long as the ultimate authority over
its management is vested in those whose only connection with it, and
interest in it, is the pursuit of gain. As industry is at present
organized, its profits and its control belong by law to that element in
it which has least to do with its success. Under the joint-stock
organization which has become normal in all the more important
industries except agriculture and building, it is managed by the
salaried agents of those by whom the property is owned. It is successful
if it returns large sums to shareholders, and unsuccessful if it does
not. If an opportunity presents itself to increase dividends by
practices which deteriorate the service or degrade the workers, the
officials who administer industry act strictly within their duty if they
seize it, for they are the servants of their employers, and their
obligation to their employers is to provide dividends not to provide
service. But the owners of property are, <em>qua</em> property-owners,
functionless, not in the sense, of course, that the tools of which they
are the proprietors are not useful, but in the sense that since work and
ownership are increasingly separated, the efficient use of the tools is
not dependent on the maintenance of the proprietary rights exercised
over them. Of course there are many managing directors who both own
capital and administer the business. But it is none the less the case
that most shareholders in most large industries are normally
shareholders and nothing more.</p>
<p>Nor is their economic interest identical, as is sometimes assumed,
with that of the general public. A society is rich when material goods,
including capital, are cheap, and human beings dear; indeed the word
“riches” has no other meaning. The interest of those who own the
property used in industry, though not, of course, of the managers who
administer industry and who themselves are servants, and often very
ill-paid servants at that, is that their capital should be dear and
human beings cheap. Hence, if the industry is such as to yield a
considerable return, or if one unit in the industry, owing to some
special advantage, produces more cheaply than its neighbours, while
selling at the same price, or if a revival of trade raises prices, or if
supplies are controlled by one of the combines which are now the rule in
many of the more important industries, the resulting surplus normally
passes neither to the managers, nor to the other employees, nor to the
public, but to the shareholders.</p>
<p>Such an arrangement is preposterous in the literal sense of being the
reverse of that which would be established by considerations of equity
and common sense, and gives rise (among other anomalies) to what is
called “the struggle between labour and capital.” The phrase is
apposite, since it is as absurd as the relations of which it is intended
to be a description. To deplore “ill-feeling”, or to advocate “harmony”,
between “labour and capital” is as rational as to lament the bitterness
between carpenters and hammers or to promote a mission for restoring
amity between mankind and its boots. The only significance of these
<em>clichés</em> is that their repetition tends to muffle their inanity,
even to the point of persuading sensible men that capital “employs”
labour, much as our pagan ancestors imagined that the pieces of wood and
iron, which they deified in their day, sent their crops and won their
battles. When men have gone so far as to talk as though their idols have
come to life, it is time that some one broke them. Labour consists of
persons, capital of things. The only use of things is to be applied to
the service of persons. The business of persons is to see that they are
there to use, and that no more than need be is paid for using them.</p>
<p>Thus the application to industry of the principle of function
involves an alteration of proprietary rights, because those rights do
not contribute, as they now are, to the end which industry exists to
serve. What gives unity to any activity, what alone can reconcile the
conflicting claims of the different groups engaged in it, is the purpose
for which it is carried on. If men have no common goal it is no wonder
that they should fall out by the way, nor are they likely to be
reconciled by a redistribution of their provisions. If they are not
content both to be servants, one or the other must be master, and it is
idle to suppose that mastership can be held in a state of suspense
between the two. There can be a division of functions between different
grades of workers, or between worker and consumer, because each, without
prejudice to the other, can have in his own sphere the authority needed
to enable him to fill it. But there cannot be a division of functions
between the worker and the owner who is owner and nothing else, for what
function does such an owner perform? The provision of capital? Then pay
him the sum needed to secure the use of his capital, but neither pay him
more nor admit him to a position of authority over production for which,
merely as an owner, he is not qualified. For this reason, while an
equilibrium between worker and manager is possible, because both are
workers, that which it is sought to establish between workers and owners
is not. It is like the offer which the Germans made to negotiate with
Belgium from Brussels. Their proposals may be excellent: but it is not
evident why they are where they are, or how, since they do not
contribute to production, they come to be putting forward proposals at
all. As long as they are in territory where they have no business to be,
their excellence as individuals will be overlooked in resentment at the
system which puts them in a position of authority.</p>
<p>It is fortunate indeed, if nothing worse than this happens. For one
way of solving the problem of the conflict of rights in industry is not
to base rights on functions, as we propose, but to base them on force.
It is to re-establish in some veiled and decorous form the institution
of slavery, by making labour compulsory. In nearly all countries a
concerted refusal to work has been made at one time or another a
criminal offence. There are to-day parts of the British Empire, as well
as of the world outside it, in which European capitalists, unchecked by
any public opinion or authority independent of themselves, are free to
impose almost what terms they please upon workmen of ignorant and
helpless races. In those districts of America where capitalism still
retains its primitive lawlessness, the same result appears to be
produced upon immigrant workmen by the threat of violence.</p>
<p>In such circumstances the conflict of rights which finds expression
in industrial warfare does not arise, because the rights of one party
have been extinguished. The simplicity of the remedy is so attractive
that it is not surprising that the Governments of industrial nations
should coquet from time to time with the policy of compulsory
arbitration. After all, it is pleaded, it is only analogous to the
action of a super-national authority which should use its common force
to prevent the outbreak of war. In reality, compulsory arbitration is
the opposite of any policy which such an authority could pursue either
with justice or with hope of success. For it takes for granted the
stability of existing relationships, and intervenes to adjust incidental
disputes upon the assumption that their equity is recognized and their
permanence desired. In industry, however, the equity of existing
relationships is precisely the point at issue. A League of Nations which
settled the quarrel between a subject race and its oppressors, between
Slavs and Magyars, or the inhabitants of what was once Prussian Poland
and the Prussian Government, on the assumption that the subordination of
Slav to Magyars and Poles to Prussians was part of an unchangeable
order, would rightly be resisted by all those who think liberty more
precious than peace. A State which, in the name of peace, should make
the concerted cessation of work a legal offence, would be guilty of a
similar betrayal of freedom. It would be solving the conflict of rights
between those who own and those who work by abolishing the rights of
those who work.</p>
</section>
<section id="b-the-extinction-of-the-capitalist" class="level2">
<h2>(b) The extinction of the Capitalist</h2>
<p>So here again, unless we are prepared to re-establish some form of
forced labour, we reach an <em>impasse</em>. But it is an
<em>impasse</em> only in so long as we regard the proprietary rights of
those who own the capital used in industry as absolute and an end in
themselves. If, instead of assuming that all property, merely because it
is property, is equally sacred, we ask what is the <em>purpose</em> for
which capital is used, what is its <em>function</em>, we shall realize
that it is not an end but a means to an end, and that its function is to
serve and assist (as the economists tell us) the labour of human beings,
not the function of human beings to serve those who happen to own
it.</p>
<p>And from this truism two consequences follow. The first is that since
capital is a thing, which ought to be used to help industry as a man may
use a bicycle to get more quickly to his work, it ought, when it is
employed, to be employed on the cheapest terms possible. The second is
that those who own it should no more control production than a man who
lets a house controls the meals which shall be cooked in the kitchen, or
a man who lets a boat the speed at which the rowers shall pull. In other
words, capital should always be got at cost price, which means, unless
public bodies find it wise, as they very well may, to own the capital
used in certain industries, it should be paid the lowest interest for
which it can be obtained, but should carry no right either to residuary
dividends or to the control of industry.</p>
<p>There are, in theory, six ways by which the control of industry by
the agents of private property-owners can be terminated. The owners may
be expropriated without compensation. They may voluntarily surrender it.
They may be frozen out by action on the part of the working
<em>personnel</em>, which itself undertakes such functions, if any, as
they have performed, and makes them superfluous by conducting production
without their assistance. Their place may be taken by associations of
consumers which supply themselves, and which vest both the ultimate
control and the residuary profits in those who use the service or
purchase the goods. Their proprietary interest may be limited or
attenuated to such a degree that they become mere <em>rentiers</em>, who
are guaranteed a fixed payment analogous to that of the
debenture-holder, but who receive no profits and bear no responsibility
for the organization of industry. They may, finally, be bought out.</p>
<p>The first alternative is exemplified by the historical confiscations
of the past, such as, for instance, the seizure of ecclesiastical
property by the ruling classes of England, Scotland and most other
Protestant states. The second has rarely, if ever, been tried—the
nearest approach to it, perhaps, was the famous abdication of August
4th, 1789. The third is the method apparently contemplated by the
building guilds which are now in process of formation in Great Britain.
The fourth method of treating the capitalist is followed by the
co-operative movement. The fifth is that recommended by the committee of
employers and trade-unionists in the building industry over which
Mr. Foster presided, and which proposed that employers should be paid a
fixed salary and a fixed rate of interest on their capital, but that all
surplus profits should be pooled and administered by a central body
representing employers and workers. The sixth has repeatedly been
practised by municipalities, and somewhat less often by national
governments.</p>
<p>Which of these alternative methods of removing industry from the
control of the property-owner is adopted is a matter of expediency to be
decided in each particular case. “Nationalization,” therefore, which is
sometimes advanced as the only method of extinguishing proprietary
rights, is merely one species of a considerable <em>genus</em>. It can
be used, of course, to produce the desired result. But it is a means to
an end, not an end in itself. Properly conceived, its object is not to
establish the State management of industry, but to remove the dead hand
of private ownership, when the private owner has ceased to perform any
positive function. It is unfortunate, therefore, that the abolition of
obstructive property rights, which is indispensable, should have been
identified with a single formula, which may be applied with advantage in
the special circumstances of some industries, but need not necessarily
be applied to all.</p>
<p>While the most elaborate scheme for the administration of a
nationalized industry advanced within recent years has come from the
Miners’ Federation, the clearest example of a practical alternative to
nationalization has been supplied by the Building Trades. The Building
Industry, which, till a few years ago, was not specially noted for
intellectual activity, has produced since the Armistice two plans of
reconstruction, neither of which owes anything to traditional
discussions of nationalization, but both of which, though in different
degrees, involve a complete breach with private ownership as hitherto
understood. The first, that of the building guilds, gets rid of the
capitalist employer in the simplest possible way. It walks round him.
The capital equipment required for building houses is relatively small.
Unlike mining or factory industry, there is in building no fixed
establishment within which alone operations can be carried on. Since it
is largely a localized industry working for a market in its immediate
neighbourhood, the productive work of the craftsman is not overshadowed
by an elaborate commercial organization. The provision of decent houses
has notoriously been the field in which, even before the war, alike in
quantity and quality, the failure of capitalist industry was at once
most disastrous and least excusable.</p>
<p>The Manchester Building Guild Committee, with the 57 building
Committees which have sprung from it in different parts of the country,
and the London Guild of Builders have taken advantage of these simple
facts, not to expropriate the employer, but to supersede him. As long as
each group of workers necessary to the building of a house insists on
acting in isolation, a business man may be needed to bring them
together. If the whole profession unites, it can serve the public
direct, without his mediation. The aim of the guilds is not profit, but
the provision of good houses at a reasonable price, on terms compatible
with the dignity of the workers. Their argument is that these two things
are really one, that the system which treats the craftsman as a “hand”
is the same as that which crowds families into tenements, and that the
latter will be properly housed only by the same associated effort as
makes the former a master in his own profession.</p>
<p>Hence the guilds are organized, not, like a trade union, for the
defence of economic rights, but for the discharge of professional duties
They do not aim at making a large surplus out of the difference between
prices and costs: indeed, it is a fundamental rule of the London Guild
of Builders that the surplus earnings cannot be distributed as
dividends, but must be used for the improvement of the service, and a
clause to the same effect formed part of the agreement reached in July,
1920, between the Manchester Guild Committee and the Ministry of Health.
What they ask is that the body for whom the work is performed shall pay
a sum which is sufficient to keep men “on the strength”, when, through
no fault of their own, there is no work for them to do. The Guild
Committee, with the aid of the Cooperative Wholesale Society and the
Co-operative Bank, buys its own materials. The Local Authority which
gives it a contract pays the prime cost of the work, <em>plus</em> an
allowance of £40 per house to cover payment for lost time, and of 6% to
cover the cost of plant and overhead charges.</p>
<p>Governed by representatives of the building trade unions, together
with administrators and technicians, and thus including craftsmen and
professional elements in a single organization, the building guild
committees command the industry in the areas where they have taken root
by commanding its <em>personnel</em>. To the Local Authorities, who have
been at their wits end to secure houses, they can offer all that is
offered by a contractor, and can offer it more effectively, for they
secure the services of the <em>elite</em> of the profession, and enjoy
the enthusiastic support of the trade unions. What they offer to the
worker is the end of the odious and degrading system under which he is
thrown aside, like unused material, whenever his services do not happen
to be required, membership in a self-governing profession, and the
consciousness that he is working for the service of his fellows, not to
make profit for an employer.</p>
<p>It is too early yet to estimate the degree of practical success which
the guilds will achieve. But young as they are, they have already
discredited the assumption that it is only the fear of unemployment and
the appetite for gain which will induce men to work effectively, for, by
general consent of all observers, the standard of zeal, efficiency, and
<em>esprit de corps</em> shown by workers on contracts undertaken by the
guilds is strikingly above what is normal in the industry. Since their
future depends entirely upon the inherent merits of the guild
organization, its demonstration that it works economically and can give
effect to its undertakings, it is difficult to understand why the
Ministry of Health, when the shortage of houses is put at anything from
120,000 to 500,000, should have sought to limit their utility by fixing
20 as the maximum number of contracts which it would sanction between
the guilds and Local Authorities.</p>
<p>The example set by the building guilds can hardly fail to be of
capital importance in all industries, such (for example) as agriculture,
where the small capital required makes it possible for a group of
workers to offer their services to the public without the intervention
of an employer. There is another way, however, of disposing of the
private owner, without nationalization, besides that of “freezing him
out.” It may be called the policy of attenuation. Ownership is not a
right, but a bundle of rights, and it is possible to strip them off
piecemeal as well as to strike them off simultaneously. The ownership of
capital involves, as we have said, three main claims; the right to
interest as the price of capital, the right to profits, and the right to
control, in virtue of which managers and workers are the servants of
shareholders. These rights in their fullest degree are not the
invariable accompaniment of ownership, nor need they necessarily
co-exist. The ingenuity of financiers long ago devised methods of
grading stock in such a way that the ownership of some carries full
control, while that of others does not, that some bear all the risk and
are entitled to all the profits, while others are limited in respect to
both. All are property, but not all carry proprietary rights of the same
degree.</p>
<p>Even while the private ownership of industrial capital still remains,
it is possible to attenuate its influence by insisting that it shall be
paid not more than a rate of interest fixed in advance, and that it
shall carry with it no right of control. In such circumstances the
position of the ordinary shareholder would approximate to that of the
owner of debentures; the property in the industry would be converted
into a mortgage on its profits; while the control of its administration
and all profits in excess of the minimum would remain to be vested
elsewhere.</p>
<p>Such a change in the character of ownership would have three
advantages. It would abolish the government of industry by property. It
would end the payment of profits to functionless shareholders by turning
them into creditors paid a fixed rate of interest. It would lay the
foundations for industrial peace by making it possible to convert
industry into a profession carried on by all grades of workers for the
service of the public, not for the gain of those who own capital. The
organization which it would produce will be described, of course, as
impracticable. It is interesting, therefore, to find it is that which
experience has led practical men to suggest as a remedy for the
disorders of one of the most important of national industries, that of
building.</p>
<p>The question before the Committee of employers and workmen, which
issued in August, 1919, a Report upon the Building Trade, was
“Scientific Management and the Reduction of Costs.”These are not phrases
which suggest an economic revolution; but it is something little short
of a revolution that the signatories of the report propose. For, as soon
as they came to grips with the problem, they found that it was
impossible to handle it effectively without reconstituting the general
fabric of industrial relationships which is its setting. Why is the
service supplied by the industry ineffective? Partly because the workers
do not give their full energies to the performance of their part in
production. Why do they not give their best energies? Because of “the
fear of unemployment, the disinclination of the operatives to make
unlimited profit for private employers, the lack of interest evinced by
operatives owing to their non-participation in control, inefficiency
both managerial and operative.” How are these psychological obstacles to
efficiency to be counteracted? By increased supervision and speeding up,
by the allurements of a premium bonus system, or the other devices by
which men who are too ingenious to have imagination or moral insight
would bully or cajole poor human nature into doing what—if only the
systems they invent would let it!—it desires to do, simple duties and
honest work? Not at all. By turning the building of houses into what
teaching now is, and what Mr. Squeers thought it could never be, an
honourable profession.</p>
<p>“We believe,” they write, “that the great task of our Industrial
Council is to develop an entirely new system of industrial control by
the members of the industry itself—the actual producers, whether by hand
or brain—and to bring them into co-operation with the State as the
central representative of the community whom they are organized to
serve.” Instead of unlimited profits, so “indispensable as an incentive
to efficiency,” the employer is to be paid a salary for his services as
manager, and a rate of interest on his capital which is to be both fixed
and (unless he fails to earn it through his own inefficiency)
guaranteed; anything in excess of it, any “profits” in fact, which in
other industries are distributed as dividends to shareholders, he is to
surrender to a central fund to be administered by employers and workmen
for the benefit of the industry as a whole. Instead of the financial
standing of each firm being treated as an inscrutable mystery to the
public, with the result that it is sometimes a mystery to itself, there
is to be a system of public costing and audit, on the basis of which the
industry will assume a collective liability for those firms which are
shown to be competently managed. Instead of the workers being dismissed
in slack times to struggle along as best they can, they are to be
maintained from a fund raised by a levy on employers and administered by
the trade unions.</p>
<p>Thus there is to be publicity as to costs and profits, open dealing
and honest work and mutual helpfulness, instead of the competition which
the nineteenth century regarded as an efficient substitute for them.
“Capital” is not to “employ labour.” Labour, which includes managerial
labour, is to employ capital; and to employ it at the cheapest rate at
which, in the circumstances of the trade, it can be got. If it employs
it so successfully that there is a surplus when it has been fairly paid
for its own services, then that surplus is not to be divided among
shareholders, for, when they have been paid interest, they have been
paid their due; it is to be used to equip the industry to provide still
more effective service in the future.</p>
<p>So here we have the majority of a body of practical men, who care
nothing for socialist theories, proposing to establish “organized Public
Service in the Building Industry,” recommending, in short, that their
industry shall be turned into a profession. And they do it, it will be
observed, by just that functional organization, just that conversion of
full proprietary rights into a mortgage secured (as far as efficient
firms are concerned) on the industry as a whole, just that transference
of the control of production from the owner of capital to those whose
business is production, which, as we said, is necessary if industry is
to be organized for the performance of service, not for the pecuniary
advantage of those who hold proprietary rights. The objection commonly
made to such proposals for a limitation of profits as were advanced by
the Building Trade Committee is that exceptional gains and exceptional
losses must be set against each other, that, on the average, profits are
not more than sufficient to evoke the supply of new capital needed, and
that it is only the possibility of large gains which secures investment
in speculative undertakings. The risks of industry, however, are of
various kinds; broadly speaking, they belong to one of three main types.
There are, in the first place, what may be called “natural risks,” which
arise from causes altogether outside the control of the individuals or
groups affected by them, such as a drought in Australia or America which
sends up the price of wool or cotton, a famine in China or India which
destroys a market, a storm at sea or a European war. There are, in the
second place, the risks of experiment or of economic progress, which are
incidental to the development of an industry, such as expenditure upon
costly investigations, experiments or new processes, of which many must
fail in order that one may succeed, or the attempt to establish a
connection with some new source of supply of raw material or some new
market for the product.</p>
<p>In the third place, there are risks incidental to competitive
industry, which are due partly to the possibility that one firm may be
undersold by another, partly, and that in a more important measure, to
the fact that, as long as each undertaking is operated as an independent
unit, the security of each is obviously less than the security of the
industry as a whole. Clearly, the larger the unit of organization, the
less, other things being equal, are the risks. A coal mine is a highly
speculative investment, for even the most skilful management, aided by
the most expert scientific advice, is liable to be baffled by
unsuspected difficulties, such as faults and water. The coal industry of
a single district is much less speculative, but even it, if, for
example, it is mainly an export district, may lose a market abroad. The
coal industry as a whole, until some other source of power replaces
coal, is speculative only to a very slight extent indeed.</p>
<p>Of these three types of risk the two first are, in one form or
another, a necessary charge which cannot be avoided. Some “natural”
risks may be, and are, made the subject of insurance. The “risks of
experiment” must obviously be incurred unless industry is to stagnate,
and must be met by setting adequate funds aside for economic expansion.
Both, on a long view, are part of the cost of production, and as costs
they should be treated. To say that profits are the payments for risks
of this kind is to claim, in effect, that they are Trust funds and are
earmarked to meet special liabilities. But then, if they are Trust
funds, they must be used as Trust funds, and must not be liable to be
raided, as now, for the payments of dividends. The sum to be set aside
to meet these risks should not be decided by the owners of capital or
their agents—for no man is fit to be judge in his own cause—but by a
joint body on which the workers, the consumers and the State would be
adequately represented. It should, in short, be removed from the vague
and indeterminate area, of which, under the name of “profits,” the owner
of capital claims to dispose as he pleases, and should be reduced to
terms sufficiently definite for discussion and criticism.</p>
<p>It is obvious, however, that “competitive risks” are in a different
category. They are not due to “the act of God,” nor are they the price
of economic progress. They arise primarily from the manner in which
industry is organized, and diminish or increase as that organization
changes. They are normally at their greatest when competition is
perfectly free; they are normally diminished when free competition is
replaced by some kind of agreement. No intelligent judgment can be
passed on the statement that profits are the payment for risk-taking and
that the speculative character of industry makes a fixed rate of
interest on capital impracticable, until it is known in precisely what
category the risks in question fall. If it is plain that such risks as
are inevitable must be borne, it is no less evident that no
justification for high profits is offered by the existence of such risks
as are not. Risks which are avoidable ought not, in short, to be paid
for; they ought to be avoided. The speculative element in industry
cannot be altogether eliminated. But to claim that the payment to
capital should be increased merely because its owners have chosen to
organize industry in a way which makes it unnecessarily speculative, is
irrational. It is like proposing that a general should be decorated
merely because, when the opportunity of a comparatively bloodless
victory was open to him, he adopted an order of battle which resulted in
numerous casualties.</p>
<p>Moreover, the present tendency of industrial organization, as
compared with that of the period from 1800 to 1880, is to diminish what
have been called the “competitive risks” of industry by bringing
competition under control, and, sometimes, by eliminating it altogether.
A whole chapter, indeed, of recent economic history is concerned with
the attempts of the business world to lighten risks by mutual
arrangements, varying from “gentlemen’s agreements” for the
stabilization of prices, through one form or another of cartel, to the
complete amalgamation of formerly independent businesses. When a really
effective combination is established, it is evident that the security of
business is greatly increased, since one whole order of risks is
eliminated altogether. The possibility of over-production followed by
reckless price-cutting is removed. More important, the credit of the
different plants in the industry becomes that of the whole.</p>
<p>In such circumstances the objection that the speculative character of
industry makes it impossible to restrict the payment made to the owner
of capital to a fixed rate of interest loses most of its weight, since
the risks which are the conventional justification for high dividends
have very largely disappeared. The capitalist may plausibly argue that
an individual cotton mill, or soap factory, or coal mine is a
speculation in which only the prospect of large profits would induce him
to invest; but he cannot say the same about Coats’ Sewing-thread
Combine, Lord Leverhulme’s Soap Trust, or the coal industry when it is
treated as a financial unit. By his own admission, when separate firms
are merged in a single combination, profits ought not, as is normally
the case, to be increased. Since the security offered is better, they
ought to be diminished.</p>
<p>The question raised by the Report of the Building Trade Committee is
whether industry cannot be so organized, even under private ownership,
that capital may be paid a stipulated rate, and that residuary profits,
when they arise, may pass to the worker and the consumer. Its suggestion
is, in effect, that, instead of the earnings of capital being treated as
an undifferentiated block, of which the directors of an enterprise can
dispose as they please, a clear discrimination should be made between
the payment needed to secure the necessary supplies of capital, the
reserves required to meet risks, the salary of the employer as manager,
and such surplus, if any, as may arise. In industries which are, in
effect, monopolies, the difficulty does not appear to be great. The
State already prescribes the sliding scale in accordance with which the
dividends of Gas Companies must be paid, and controls—a necessary
corollary—the issue of new capital. There does not appear to be any
insuperable objection to making the adoption of a similar arrangement a
condition precedent to the sanctioning of combination in other
industries. Were that course pursued, the firms concerned would pay the
market rate of interest, but no more; and the surplus profits now
received by shareholders in (for example) Coats’ Combine, would be
returned to the consumer in lower prices and to the worker in improved
conditions.</p>
<p>In industries which are not controlled by a combination, an
alternative course is suggested by the proposal of the Building Trade
Committee that the trade should combine so far as is needed to place a
financial guarantee behind those firms which satisfy a body representing
the whole trade that they are competently managed. When even this degree
of united action is impossible, there would remain the proposal that
firms should be required, before they distribute any dividends, to set
aside a prescribed sum (equal, for example, to a certain proportion of
their paid-up capital) as reserves to meet risks, and that, when that
sum had been provided, the maximum percentage to be paid to shareholders
should be fixed by a Public Authority, and issues of new capital made
only with its sanction.</p>
<p>Whether such proposals are adopted or not, the Building Trades
Committee are undoubtedly right in thinking that it is no longer
sufficient to defend profits in general terms by the statement that
there is a “rough correspondence” between profits and risks. A rough
correspondence, when it exists, is not sufficient. The argument that
business is a lottery, and that profits and losses cancel each other, is
not likely to be accepted, until it is proved beyond doubt that it is
impossible for the productive work of the world to be organized upon
methods more dignified and rational than those of the gambling saloon,
from the analogy of which such double-edged arguments appear often to be
drawn.</p>
<p>The present position of the capitalist employer resembles, it may be
suggested, that of a king in the days when no clear distinction was made
between the personal and the official revenue of the monarchy. The
result of that situation is a matter of history. Kings (like employers)
were not worse than other men. But they spent on themselves money which
they should have spent on the business of the nation. Parliaments (like
trade unions) were not more short-sighted than other bodies. But they
cut down the revenue available for public necessities, in order to
prevent it being wasted on private luxuries. And the efficiency of the
public services suffered from both alike, as the efficiency of industry
suffers to-day. The remedy discovered after some centuries of struggle
was to make a sharp division between the personal and the official
revenue of the monarch by the establishment of a Civil List.</p>
<p>To put himself upon a “Civil List” would be the course of wisdom for
the private employer who desires, not merely to cling to every tittle of
his power, but to adapt his position to a new situation. In the
circumstances of the moment, a policy of prudent conservatism would have
as its object, it may be suggested, to narrow the area of contentious
twilight which at present surrounds the financial operations of
industry. It would make a point of placing all figures as to costs and
profits on the table. It would discriminate sharply between interest and
profits, and would prove that no higher payment was made to capital than
was necessary, in the conditions of the market, to obtain its services.
It would aim, in short, both at converting the capitalist into a
<em>rentier</em> and at striking an alliance between managerial and
other kinds of labour, which would be strong enough to put pressure upon
him.</p>
<p>Compared, however, either with the programme of the Building Guilds
or with Public Ownership, this proposal to retain the private employer,
while limiting his functions and converting him from a profit-maker into
a manager has, with all its attractions, certain obvious disadvantages.
For one thing, the real capital of a business is often almost
undiscoverable. For another thing, the course suggested is open to the
objection that it circumscribes the authority which at present directs
industry, without, like either of the alternative proposals, providing
an effective substitute for it. Had the movement against the control of
production by property taken place before the rise of limited companies,
in which ownership is separated from management, the transition to the
organization of industry as a profession might also have taken place, as
the employers and workmen in the building trade propose that it should,
by limiting the rights of private ownership without abolishing it. But
that is not what has actually happened, and therefore the proposals of
the building trade are not capable of general application. It may be
possible to retain private ownership in building and in industries like
building, while changing its character, precisely because in building
the employer is normally not merely an owner, but something else as
well. He is a manager; that is, he is a workman. And because he is a
workman, whose interests, and still more whose professional spirit as a
workman may often outweigh his interests and merely financial spirit as
an owner, he can form part of the productive organization of the
industry, after his rights as an owner have been trimmed and
limited.</p>
<p>But that dual position is abnormal, and in the highly organized
industries is becoming more abnormal every year. In coal, in cotton, in
shipbuilding, in many branches of engineering the owner of capital is
not, as he is in building, an organizer or manager. His connection with
the industry and his interest in it is purely financial. He is an owner
and nothing more. And because his interest is merely financial, so that
his concern is dividends, and production only as a means to dividends,
he cannot be worked into an organization of industry which vests
administration in a body representing all grades of producers, or
producers and consumers together, for he has no purpose in common with
them. Joint councils between workers and managers may succeed, but joint
councils between workers and owners or agents of owners, like most of
the so-called Whitley Councils, will not, because the necessity for the
mere owner is itself one of the points in dispute.</p>
<p>The master builder, who owns the capital used, can be included, not
<em>qua</em> capitalist, but <em>qua</em> builder, if he surrenders some
of the rights of ownership, as the Building Industry Committee proposed
that he should. But if the shareholder in a colliery or a shipyard
abdicates the control and unlimited profits to which, <em>qua</em>
capitalist, he is at present entitled, he abdicates everything that
makes him what he is, and has no other standing in the industry. He
cannot share like the master builder, in its management, because he has
no qualifications which would enable him to do so. His object is profit;
and if industry is to become, as employers and workers in the building
trade propose, an “organized public service,” then its subordination to
the shareholders whose object is profit, is, as they clearly see,
precisely what must be eliminated. The master builders propose to give
it up. They can do so because they have their place in the industry in
virtue of their function as workmen. But if the shareholder gave it up,
he would have no place at all.</p>
<p>In coal mining, therefore, where ownership and management are sharply
separated, the owners will not admit the bare possibility of any system
in which the control of the administration of the mines is shared
between the management and the miners. “I am authorized to state on
behalf of the Mining Association,” Lord Gainford, the chief witness on
behalf of the mine-owners, informed the Coal Commission, “that if the
owners are not to be left complete executive control they will decline
to accept the responsibility for carrying on the industry.”So the
mine-owners blow away in a sentence the whole body of plausible
make-believe which rests on the idea that, while private ownership
remains unaltered, industrial harmony can be produced by the magic
formula of joint control. And they are right. The representatives of
workmen and shareholders, in mining and in other industries, can meet
and negotiate and discuss. But joint administration of the shareholders’
property by a body representing shareholders and workmen is impossible,
because there is no purpose in common between them. For the only purpose
which could unite all persons engaged in industry, and overrule their
particular and divergent interests, is the provision of service. And the
object of shareholders, the whole significance and metier of industry to
them, is not the provision of service but the provision of
dividends.</p>

<section id="c-nationalization-as-a-problem-in-constitution-making" class="level2">
<h2>(c) Nationalization as a problem in Constitution-making</h2>
<p>Hence in industries where management is divorced from ownership, as
in most of the highly organized trades it is to-day, there is no obvious
halfway house between the retention of the present system and the
complete extrusion of the capitalist from the control of production. The
change in the character of ownership, which is necessary in order that
coal or textiles and shipbuilding may be organized as professions for
the service of the public, cannot easily spring from within. The blow
needed to liberate them from the control of the property-owner must come
from without.</p>
<p>In theory it might be struck by action on the part of the organized
workers, who would abolish residuary profits and the right of control by
the mere procedure of refusing to work as long as they were maintained,
on the historical analogy offered by peasants who have destroyed
predatory property in the past by declining to pay its dues and admit
its government, in which case Parliament would intervene only to
register the community’s assent to the <em>fait accompli</em>. Some such
result appears to have been the design of the recent action of the
Italian workers in seizing the factories. In England, however, the
conditions of modern industry being what they are, that course, apart
from its other disadvantages, is so unlikely to be attempted, or, if
attempted, to succeed, that it can be neglected. The alternative to it
is that the change in the character of property should be affected by
legislation in virtue of which the rights of ownership in an industry
are bought out simultaneously.</p>
<p>In either case, though the procedure is different, the result of the
change, once it is accomplished, is the same. Private property in
capital, in the sense of the right to profits and control, is abolished.
What remains of it is, at most, a mortgage in favour of the previous
proprietors, a dead leaf which is preserved, though the sap of industry
no longer feeds it, as long as it is not thought worth while to I strike
it off. And since the capital needed to maintain and equip a modern
industry could not be T provided by any one group of workers, even were
it desirable on other grounds that they should step completely into the
position of the present owners, the complex of rights which constitutes
ownership remains to be shared between them and whatever organ may act
on behalf of the general community. The former, for example, may be the
heir of the present owners as far as the control of the routine and
administration of industry is concerned: the latter may succeed to their
right to dispose of residuary profits. The elements composing property,
have, in fact, to be disentangled: and the fact that to-day, under the
common name of ownership, several different powers are vested in
identical hands, must not be allowed to obscure the probability that,
once private property in capital has been abolished, it may be expedient
to reallocate those powers in detail as well as to transfer them <em>en
bloc</em>.</p>
<p>The essence of a profession is, as we have suggested, that its
members organize themselves for the performance of function. It is
essential therefore, if industry is to be professionalized, that the
abolition of functionless property should be not interpreted to imply a
continuance under public ownership of the absence of responsibility on
the part of the <em>personnel</em> of industry, which is the normal
accompaniment of private ownership working through the wage-system. It
is the more important to emphasize that point, because such an
implication has sometimes been conveyed in the past by some of those who
have presented the case for such a change in the character of ownership
as has been urged above.</p>
<p>The name consecrated by custom to the transformation of property by
public and external action is Nationalization. But Nationalization is a
word which is neither very felicitous nor free from ambiguity. Properly
used, it means merely ownership by a body representing the nation—“the
nation” considered as the general public of consumers, rather than as
the subjects of a particular political allegiance; and when it can be
shown that the territorial state is not a suitable organization for the
administration of industry, the case for “nationalization,” in the sense
of public ownership, remains unaltered. It is an unfortunate chance that
English speaking peoples employ one word to express what in France and
Germany are expressed by two, <em>étatisation</em> or
<em>Verstaatlichung</em> and socialisation or
<em>Sozialisierung</em>,—words which in those languages, unlike the
common English practice, are used, not as synonyms, but as
antitheses—and that no language possesses a vocabulary to express neatly
the finer shades in the numerous possible varieties of organization
under which a public service may be carried on.</p>
<p>The result has been that the singularly colourless word
“Nationalization” almost inevitably tends to be charged with a highly
specialized and quite arbitrary body of suggestions. It has come in
practice to be used as equivalent to a particular method of
administration, under which officials employed by the State step into
the position of the present directors of industry, and exercise all the
power which they exercised. So those who desire to maintain the system
under which industry is carried on, not as a profession serving the
public, but for the advantage of shareholders, attack nationalization on
the ground that state management is necessarily inefficient, and tremble
with apprehension whenever they post a letter in a letter-box; and those
who desire to change it reply that state services are efficient, and
praise God whenever they use a telephone; as though either private or
public administration had certain peculiar and unalterable
characteristics, instead of depending for its quality, like an army or
railway company or school, and all other undertakings, public and
private alike, not on whether those who conduct it are private officials
or state officials, but on whether they are properly trained for their
work and can command the good will and confidence of their
subordinates.</p>
<p>The arguments on both sides are ingenious, but in reality nearly all
of them are beside the point. The merits of nationalization do not stand
or fall with the efficiency or inefficiency of existing state
departments as administrators of industry. For nationalization, which
means public ownership, does not involve placing industry under the
machinery of the political state, with its civil servants controlled, or
nominally controlled, by Cabinet Ministers, and is compatible with
several different types of management. The constitution of the industry
may be “unitary,” as is (for example) that of the post-office. Or it may
be “federal,” as was that designed by Mr. Justice Sankey for the coal
industry. Administration may be centralized or decentralized. The
authorities to whom it is entrusted may be composed of representatives
of the consumers, or of representatives of professional associations, or
of state officials, or of all three in several different proportions.
Executive work may be placed in the hands of civil servants, trained,
recruited, and promoted as in the existing state departments, or a new
service may be created with a procedure and standards of its own. The
industry may be subject to Treasury control, or it may be financially
autonomous. The problem is, in fact, of a familiar, though difficult,
order. It is one of constitution making.</p>
<p>It is commonly assumed by controversialists that the organization and
management of a nationalized industry must, for some undefined reason,
be similar to that of the Post-Office. One might as reasonably suggest
that the pattern and exemplar of private enterprise must be the Steel
Corporation or the Imperial Tobacco Company. The administrative systems
obtaining in a society which has nationalized its foundation industries
will, in fact, be as various as in one that resigns them to private
ownership; and to discuss their relative advantages, without defining
what particular type of each is the subject of reference, is to-day as
unhelpful as to approach a modern political problem in terms of the
Aristotelian classification of constitutions.</p>
<p>The highly abstract dialectics as to “enterprise,” “initiative,”
“bureaucracy,” “red tape,” “democratic control,” “state management,”
which fill the press of countries occupied with industrial problems,
really belong to the dark ages of economic thought. If the student of
these questions would wave aside for a moment the inflammatory images of
hide-bound pedantry and irresponsible caprice which such phrases evoke,
and would consider dispassionately the various types of organization I
adopted or suggested, which alone matter in practice, he might be less
confident as to the merits or demerits of public ownership in general,
but he would be in a better position to pronounce an opinion upon some
particular examples of it. He would discover that the varieties of
administrative and managerial system applied to public services have
been at least as numerous as the undertakings which have been
“nationalized,” and considerably more numerous than the societies which
have “nationalized” them.</p>
<p>Apart from differences in the area over which the service is
supplied, in the degree of centralization with which it is administered,
and in relations to private business ranging from competition on equal
terms to complete monopoly, the management of public undertakings may
belong to one of several types. The practice of Great Britain, as
exemplified by the Post Office, by Woolwich Arsenal and by the National
Dockyards, has been to apply to the control of industry the same type of
organization as to those Departments, such as the Home Office, which are
not concerned with production. Administration is committed to civil
servants under a ministerial head with a seat in the Cabinet, and the
efficiency of the service is supposed to be maintained by the Minister’s
liability to Parliamentary criticism.</p>
<p>This system has developed, not as the result of any deliberate
decision as to its merits, but through the extension to reproductive
undertakings of precedents derived from services of another kind. A
constitution of such a type, based on political analogies, is not the
only constitution possible, nor is it even the commonest; and if it is
desired to discover some substitute for it, several alternatives are
already in existence. In Australia, and, since the nationalization of
certain of its great railways, in Canada, the State Railways are
administered by Boards of Commissioners who are practically irremovable
during their term of office, and the permanent commission is a favourite
device in American Cities. The constitution adopted for the British
Liquor Control Board vested authority in the hands of a body composed of
representatives of certain great Departments, of labour organizations
and of employers, with an admixture of experts. The bodies administering
the public undertakings of British Local Authorities consist usually of
Committees of elected Councillors. But public docks and harbours are
controlled by bodies representing the users of the service. The Port of
London Authority set up by the Act of 1908 (which has a very bad
constitution) consists, in addition to a Chairman and Vice-Chairman, of
18 members elected, on an elaborate system of plural voting based on
property, by payers of dues, wharfingers and owners of river craft, and
of 10 appointed members, of whom two must be representatives of labour.
The London Water Board, which replaced the London Water Companies, and
which administers a capital of some £49,000,000 and supplies water to a
population of about 7,000,000 persons, is composed under the Act of 1902
of 66 members appointed. by the Local Authorities of the areas
served.</p>
<p>Normally it appears to be held that the consumers are adequately
protected by the criticism which is supposed to come from a
representative body, whether Parliament or a Municipal Council. But
sometimes, as in connection with the Ministry of Food, special machinery
for expressing their demands and criticisms has been established. The
miners proposed that, if the mines were transferred to public ownership,
in addition to the representation given the consumer on the District
Mining Councils and the National Mining Council, a permanent Fuel
Consumer’s Council should be set up, representing users of household and
industrial coal, which would have the right to call for full
information, to press, when it thought fit, for changes of method and
policy, and to meet in joint session the body administering the
industry. In view of the complete helplessness of the ordinary
householder when confronted with a rise of price hitherto, and of the
well-known fact that collieries and distributors took advantage of every
cold snap or threatened dispute to raise prices against him, there is
something cynically comic in the suggestion that he has anything but an
immense increase in influence and in power of self-protection to gain
from public ownership accompanied by such a scheme of administration as
was advanced by the miners and by Mr. Justice Sankey.</p>
<p>It may be remarked in parenthesis, indeed, that the view commonly
expressed by the business world, that a public service is likely to ride
roughshod over the consumer, appears to be the precise opposite of the
truth. The real danger is lest it should be too pliable, and should
sacrifice the permanent interests of the service to the demand for
immediate cheapness. The instantaneous outcry against “inefficiency,”
“waste” and “bureaucratic tyranny,” by which the proposal to increase
the charges made by a nationalized service is met, is in itself the very
best evidence of the protection to the consumer which is offered by
Public Ownership. In private industry the prices of clothes, boots, food
and a dozen other commodities rose by over 160% between 1914 and 1921,
and no one did more than utter an occasional grumble. But the proposal
of the Post Office to raise telephone charges evoked in the business
world a storm of indignation. As the users of underground and suburban
railways know to their cost, certain Railway Companies habitually sell
non-existent places in third-class carriages, and if, much against his
will, the unfortunate traveller enters a carriage of another class,
proceed to collect from him the excess fare to which the inadequacy of
their arrangements have made him liable. If the railways were
nationalized the Press would ring with protests against State
incompetence and the sharp practice of officials. Since they are in
private hands, not a murmur is heard. The explanation is simple. The
policy of a public undertaking can be modified by criticism, that of a
private business cannot. The former is held to be acting improperly if
it squeezes the consumer; the latter would often be regarded as highly
eccentric if it did anything else.</p>
<p>Not only may the composition of the controlling body, and its
relations to the users of the service, vary enormously, but its
relations to its employees may be even more diverse. It may treat all of
them as established “Civil Servants,” or it may so treat none of them.
It may, as the British Ministry of Transport has proposed, and as the
French, Swiss and Italian State Railway Administrations have done, give
the workers direct representation on the Authorities governing the
industry, or it may treat them as “hands” even to the fullest extent
demanded by the British Railway Companies. The fact that they are public
servants may make no difference to their civil rights; or, as in Prussia
before 1914, they may be dismissed if they join a union. They may be
allowed to join a union, but they may be told, like the shipyards
employees of the British Admiralty, that they are not allowed to strike,
or like the Postal Servants, that they must not criticize the
administration of the service. Finally, an attempt may be made, as at
one time in Australia, to neutralize the political influence which they
are supposed to wield, by creating a special constituency for them.</p>
<p>Such are a few of the varieties of organization which lie on the
surface. When one turns from them to consider the proposals advanced,
they are found to be almost inexhaustible. The attempt to apply a single
standard of criticism, based on the mere word Nationalization, to the
administration of Prussian coal mines before 1914, the four different
reports of the two recent German coal commissions, the programmes of
Mr. Justice Sankey and of the Miners’ Federation and the half dozen
different plans of administration brought before the British Coal
Commission, to the American “Plumb plan,” the proposals of the British
Railway Nationalization Council, and the fifty odd programmes of public
ownership which are afoot, frequently with official sanction, in the
near East, is merely unintelligent. It is like supposing that France and
America are governed in the same way merely because they are both called
Republics, or that down to 191 8 Prussia had the same constitution as
England because it was called a monarchy.</p>
<p>It is noticeable, indeed, that the chief characteristic of almost all
recent programmes of nationalization has been the insistence that the
administration of a nationalized industry should not, except when
unavoidable, be entrusted to the ordinary machinery of the political
state. In Great Britain, France, Germany, Italy, and the British
Dominions—to go no further afield—there appears to be general agreement
among all contemporary supporters of the policy of public ownership
that, though the State must intervene to carry out the <em>act</em> of
expropriation by due process of law, the <em>administrative body</em>
which <em>succeeds</em> the private proprietor must not be a department
directly dependent on the Government of the day, but an authority
representing at least those who supply the service and those who use it,
and acting with as much elasticity as it is possible for any large scale
organization, whether public or private, to achieve. Whether that
conclusion—which, be it observed, is the precise opposite of the views
usually ascribed to advocates of nationalization by their critics—is
accepted or not, serious discussion of the future of industry, as
distinct from mere polemics, will not progress until it is recognised
that the problem is one of making a constitution, and that in making a
constitution, words, so long as they are not outrageous, are less
important than facts. The fact is that public ownership, like private
enterprise, may be accompanied by any one of a dozen different systems
of organization, and that its effect, good or bad, will depend, not upon
the name used to describe it, but upon which particular system of
organization is adopted in any given case.</p>
<p>The first task of the student, whatever his personal conclusions, is,
it may be suggested, to contribute what he can to the restoration of
sanity by insisting that instead of the argument being conducted with
the counters of a highly inflated and rapidly depreciating verbal
currency, the exact situation, in so far as is possible, shall be stated
as it is; uncertainties (of which there are many) shall be treated as
uncertain, and the precise meaning of alternative proposals shall be
strictly defined. Not the least of the merits of Mr. Justice Sankey’s
report was that, by stating in great detail the type of organization
which he recommended for the Coal Industry, he imparted a new precision
and reality into the whole discussion. Whether his conclusions are
accepted or rejected, it is from the basis of clearly defined proposals
such as his that the future discussion of these problems must proceed.
It may not find a solution. It will at least do something to create the
temper in which alone a reasonable solution can be sought.</p>
<p>Nationalization, then, is not an end, but a means to an end, and when
the question of ownership has been settled the question of
administration remains for solution. As a means it is likely to be
indispensable in those industries in which the rights of private
proprietors cannot easily be modified without the action of the State,
just as the purchase of land by county councils is a necessary step to
the establishment of small holders, when landowners will not voluntarily
part with their property for the purpose. But the object in purchasing
land is to establish small holders, not to set up farms administered by
state officials; and the object of nationalizing mining or railways or
the manufacture of steel should not be to establish any particular form
of state management, but to release those who do constructive work from
the control of those whose sole interest is pecuniary gain, in order
that they may be free to apply their energies to the true purpose of
industry, which is the provision of service, not the provision of
dividends.</p>
<p>When the transference of property has taken place, it will probably
be found that the necessary provision for the government of industry
will involve not merely the freedom of the producers to produce, but the
creation of machinery through which the consumer, for whom he produces,
can express his wishes and criticize the way in which they are met, as
at present he normally cannot. But that is the second stage in the
process of reorganizing industry for the performance of function, not
the first. The first is to free it from its present subordination to the
pecuniary interests of the owner of property, because they are the
magnetic pole which sets all the compasses wrong, and which causes
industry, however swiftly it may progress, to progress in the wrong
direction.</p>
<p>Nor does this change in the character of property involve a breach
with the existing order so sharp as to be impracticable. The phraseology
of political controversy continues to reproduce the conventional
antitheses of the early nineteenth century; “private enterprise” and
“public ownership” are still’ contrasted with each other as light with
darkness or darkness with light. But, in reality, behind the formal
shell of the traditional legal system, the elements of a new body of
relationships have already been prepared, and find piecemeal application
through policies devised, not by socialists, but by men who repeat the
formulae of individualism, at the very moment when they are undermining
it. The Esch-Cummins Act in America, the Act establishing a Ministry of
Transport in England, Sir Arthur Duckham’s scheme for the organization
of the coal mines, the proposals with regard to the coal industry
advanced at one time by the British Government itself, appear to have
the common characteristic of retaining private ownership in name, while
attenuating it in fact, by placing its operations under the supervision,
accompanied sometimes by a financial guarantee, of a public
authority.</p>
<p>Schemes of this general character appear, indeed, to be the first
instinctive reaction produced by the discovery that private enterprise
is no longer functioning effectively. It is probable that they possess
certain merits of a technical order, analogous to those associated with
the amalgamation of competing forms into a single combination. It is
questionable, however, whether the compromise which they represent is
permanently tenable. What, after all, it may be asked, are the
advantages of private ownership when it has been pared down to the point
which policies of this order propose? May not the “owner,” whose rights
they are designed to protect, not unreasonably reply to their authors,
“Thank you for nothing”? Individual enterprise has its merits: so also,
perhaps, has public ownership. But, by the time these schemes have done
with it, not much remains of “the simple and obvious system of natural
liberty,” while their inventors are precluded from appealing to the
motives which are emphasized by advocates of nationalization. It is one
thing to be an entrepreneur with a world of adventure and unlimited
profits—if they can be achieved—before one. It is quite another to be a
director of a railway company or coal corporation with a minimum rate of
profit guaranteed by the State, and a maximum rate of profit which
cannot be exceeded. Hybrids are apt to be sterile. It may be questioned
whether, in drawing the teeth of private capitalism, this type of
compromise does not draw out most of its virtues as well.</p>
<p>So, when a certain stage of economic development has been reached,
private ownership, by the admission of its defenders, can no longer be
tolerated in the only form in which it is free to display the
characteristic, and quite genuine, advantages for the sake of which it
used to be defended. And, as step by step it is whittled down by tacit
concessions to the practical necessity of protecting the consumer, or
eliminating waste, or meeting the claims of the workers, public
ownership becomes, not only on social grounds, but for reasons of
economic efficiency, the alternative to a type of private ownership
which appears to carry with it few of the rights which are normally
valued in ownership and to be singularly devoid of privacy.</p>
<p>It would be a mistake to visualize the displacement of the private
capitalist from his position of economic sovereignty as taking place
only through the process of nationalization. Over a considerable field
of industry the Co-operative Movement has already substituted the motive
of communal service for that of profit, and supplies annually to its
members, through bodies representing the consumers, goods to the value
of some hundred million pounds. It has found a genuine and practicable
alternative to the conduct of industry by the agents of shareholders for
the pecuniary gain of shareholders, and has thus established the first
condition without which an effective partnership between producer and
consumer is impossible. The extension of State ownership will take
place, it may be suggested, without in any way impinging on the
activities of the Co-operative Movement, or on the experiments in
“industrial self-government” such as are now being made in the building
industry. Its special sphere will be the great foundation industries,
which, so far, have set at defiance the one movement and the other.</p>
<p>Inevitably and unfortunately the change must be gradual. But it
should be continuous. When, as in the last few years, the State has
acquired the ownership of great masses of industrial capital, it should
retain it, instead of surrendering it to private capitalists, who
protest at once that it will be managed so inefficiently that it will
not pay and managed so efficiently that it will undersell them. When
estates are being broken up and sold, as they are at present, public
bodies should enter the market and acquire them.</p>
<p>Most important of all, the ridiculous barrier which at present
prevents English Local Authorities from acquiring property in land and
industrial capital, except for purposes specified by Act of Parliament,
should be abolished, and they should be free to undertake such services,
including (in so far as it is not already covered by Co-operation) the
whole field of retail distribution, as their citizens may desire.
According to the theory upon which the Local Government of Great Britain
is at present based, Local Authorities, from the tiniest Parish Council
to the largest County Borough, can exercise only the powers specially
conferred on them by Parliament, and, if they desire additional powers,
they can obtain them only by the cumbrous and expensive process of
private bill legislation. This strict limitation of the sphere of Local
Authorities dates from the Municipal Corporations Act of 1835, which was
admirable in its reconstruction of the machinery of municipal
government, but which was passed at a time when almost the only proper
functions of local bodies were conceived to be the preservation of
public order and the administration of local finances.</p>
<p>In an age when Municipal Corporations were corrupt oligarchies, the
main object of reformers was, not to increase their powers, but to
diminish their abuses. But there is no analogy between modern
municipalities and the strongholds of incompetence and privilege which
were reformed eighty years ago. So far, at least, as County Boroughs are
concerned, the right principle is that, instead of their being allowed
to do only what they are expressly empowered to do, they should be free
to do anything which they are not forbidden to do. Central control is
necessary, in order to ensure that posterity is not burdened by
excessive capital expenditure, to preserve a minimum standard of
efficiency, and to adjust the claims of conflicting authorities. But,
provided these conditions are satisfied, there is no reason why great
Municipal Corporations should not undertake such services as they may
from time to time deem expedient. The objection to public ownership, in
so far as it is intelligent, is in reality largely an objection to
over-centralization. But the remedy for over-centralization is not the
maintenance of functionless property in private hands, but the
decentralized ownership of public property. When Birmingham and
Manchester and Leeds are the little republics which they should be,
there is no reason to anticipate that they will tremble at a whisper
from Whitehall.</p>
<p>These things should be done steadily and continuously, quite apart
from the special cases like that of the mines, railways, and canals,
where the private ownership of capital is stated by the experts to have
been responsible for intolerable waste, or the manufacture of armaments
and alcoholic liquor, which are politically and socially too dangerous
to be left in private hands. They should be done not in order to
establish a single form of bureaucratic management, but in order to
release industry from the domination of proprietary interests, which,
whatever the form of management, are not merely troublesome in detail
but vicious in principle, because they divert it from the performance of
function to the acquisition of gain. If at the same time private
ownership is shaken, as recently it has been, by action on the part of
particular groups of workers, so much the better. There are more ways of
killing a cat than drowning it in cream, and it is all the more likely
to choose the cream if they are explained to it. But the two methods are
complementary, not alternative, and the attempt to found rival schools
on an imaginary incompatibility between them is a bad case of the
<em>odium sociologicum</em> which afflicts reformers.</p>
</section>

<section id="the-vicious-circle" class="level1">
<h1>The “Vicious Circle”</h1>
<p>What form of management should replace the administration of industry
by the agents of shareholders? What is most likely to hold it to its
main purpose, and to be least at the mercy of predatory interests and
functionless supernumeraries, and of the alternations of sullen
dissatisfaction and spasmodic revolt which at present distract it?
Whatever the system upon which industry is administered, one thing is
certain. Its economic processes and results must be public, because only
if they are public can it be known whether the service of industry is
vigilant, effective and honourable, whether its purpose is being
realised and its function carried out. The defence of secrecy in
business resembles the defence of adulteration on the ground that it is
a legitimate weapon of competition; indeed it has even less
justification than that famous doctrine, for the condition of effective
competition is publicity, and one motive for secrecy is to prevent
it.</p>
<p>Those who conduct industry at the present time, and who are most
emphatic that (as the Duke of Wellington said of the un-reformed House
of Commons, they “have never read or heard of any measure up to the
present moment which can in any degree satisfy the mind”) the method of
conducting it can in any way be improved, are also those apparently who,
with some honourable exceptions, are most reluctant that the full facts
about it should be known. And it is crucial that they should be known.
It is crucial not only because, in the present ignorance of the real
economic situation, all industrial disagreements tend inevitably to be
battles in the dark, in which “ignorant armies clash by night,” but
because, unless there is complete publicity as to profits and costs, it
is impossible to form any judgment either of the reasonableness of the
prices which are charged or of the claims to remuneration of the
different parties engaged in production. For balance sheets, with their
opportunities for concealing profits, give no clear light upon the
first, and no light at all upon the second. And so, when the facts come
out, the public is aghast at revelations which show that industry is
conducted with bewildering financial extravagance. If the full facts had
been published, as they should have been, quarter by quarter, these
revelations would probably not have been made at all, because publicity
itself would have been an antiseptic and there would have been nothing
sensational to reveal.</p>
<p>The events of the last few years are a lesson which should need no
repetition. The Government, surprised at the price charged for making
shells at a time when its soldiers were ordered by Headquarters not to
fire more than a few rounds per day, whatever the need for retaliation,
because there were not more than a few to fire, establishes a costing
department to analyse the estimates submitted by manufacturers and to
compare them, item by item, with the cost in its own factories. It finds
that, through the mere pooling of knowledge, “some of the reductions
made in the price of shells and similar munitions,” as the chartered
accountant employed by the department tells us, “have been as high as
50% of the original price.” The household consumer grumbles at the price
of coal. For once in a way, amid a storm of indignation from influential
persons engaged in the industry, the facts are published. And what do
they show? That, after 2/6 has been added to the already high price of
coal because the poorer mines are alleged not to be paying their way,
21% of the output examined by the Commission was produced at a profit of
1/- to 3/- per ton, 32% at a profit of 3/- to 5/-, 13% at a profit of
5/- to 7/-, and 14% at a profit of 7/- per ton and over, while the
profits of distributors in London alone amount in the aggregate to over
£500,000, and the co-operative movement, which aims not at profit, but
at service, distributes household coal at a cost of from 2/- to 4/- less
per ton than is charged by the coal trade!</p>
<p>“But these are exceptions.” They may be. It is possible that in the
industries, in which, as the recent Committee on Trusts has told us,
“powerful Combinations or Consolidations of one kind or another are in a
position effectively to control output and prices,” not only costs are
cut to the bare minimum but profits are inconsiderable. But then why
insist on this humiliating tradition of secrecy with regard to them,
when everyone who uses their products, and everyone who renders honest
service to production, stands to gain by publicity? If industry is to
become a profession, whatever its management, the first of its
professional rules should be, as Sir John Mann told the Coal Commission,
that “all cards should be placed on the table.” If it were the duty of a
Public Department to publish quarterly exact returns as to costs of
production and profits in all the firms throughout an industry, the gain
in mere productive efficiency, which should appeal to our enthusiasts
for output, would be considerable; for the organization whose costs were
least would become the standard with which all other types of
organization would be compared. The gain in <em>morale</em>, which is
also, absurd though it may seem, a condition of efficiency, would be
incalculable. For industry would be conducted in the light of day. Its
costs, necessary or unnecessary, the distribution of the return to it,
reasonable or capricious, would be a matter of common knowledge. It
would be held to its purpose by the mere impossibility of persuading
those who make its products or those who consume them to acquiesce, as
they acquiesce now, in expenditure which is meaningless because it has
contributed nothing to the service which the industry exists to
perform.</p>
<p>The organization of industry as a profession does not involve only
the abolition of functionless property, and the maintenance of publicity
as the indispensable condition of a standard of professional honour. It
implies also that those who perform its work should undertake that its
work is performed effectively. It means that they should not merely be
held to the service of the public by fear of personal inconvenience or
penalties, but that they should treat the discharge of professional
responsibilities as an obligation attaching not only to a small
<em>elite</em> of intellectuals, managers or “bosses,” who perform the
technical work of “business management,” but as implied by the mere
entry into the industry and as resting on the corporate consent and
initiative of the rank and file of workers. It is precisely, indeed, in
the degree to which that obligation is interpreted as attaching to all
workers, and not merely to a select class, that the difference between
the existing industrial order, collectivism and the organization of
industry as a profession resides. The first involves the utilization of
human beings for the purpose of private gain; the second their
utilization for the purpose of public service; the third the association
in the service of the public of their professional pride, solidarity and
organization.</p>
<p>The difference in administrative machinery between the second and
third might not be considerable. Both involve the drastic limitation, or
the transference to the public, of the proprietary rights of the
existing owners of industrial capital. Both would necessitate machinery
for bringing the opinion of the consumers to bear upon the service
supplied them by the industry. The difference consists in the manner in
which the obligations of the producer to the public are conceived. He
may either be the executer of orders transmitted to him by its agents;
or he may, through his organization, himself take a positive part in
determining what those orders should be.</p>
<p>In the former case he is responsible for his own work, but not for
anything else. If he hews his stint of coal, it is no business of his
whether the pit is a failure; if he puts in the normal number of rivets,
he disclaims all further interest in the price or the seaworthiness of
the ship. In the latter his function embraces something more than the
performance of the specialized piece of work allotted to him. It
includes also a responsibility for the success of the undertaking as a
whole. And since responsibility is impossible without power, his
position would involve at least so much power as is needed to secure
that he can affect in practice the conduct of the industry. It is this
collective liability for the maintenance of a certain quality of service
which is, indeed, the distinguishing feature of a profession. It is
compatible with several different kinds of government, or indeed, when
the unit of production is, not a group, but an individual, with hardly
any government at all. What it does involve is that the individual,
merely by entering the profession, should have committed himself to
certain obligations in respect of its conduct, and that the professional
organization, whatever it may be, should have sufficient power to enable
it to maintain them.</p>
<p>The demand for the participation of the workers in the control of
industry is usually advanced in the name of the producer, as a plea for
economic freedom or industrial democracy. “Political freedom,” writes
the Final Report of the United States Commission on Industrial
Relations, which was presented in 1916, “can exist only where there is
industrial freedom… There are now within the body of our Republic
industrial communities which are virtually Principalities, oppressive to
those dependent upon them for a livelihood and a dreadful menace to the
peace and welfare of the nation.” The vanity of Englishmen may soften
the shadows and heighten the lights. But the concentration of authority
is too deeply rooted in the very essence of Capitalism for differences
in the degree of the arbitrariness with which it is exercised to be
other than trivial. The control of a large works does, in fact, confer a
kind of private jurisdiction in matters concerning the life and
livelihood of the workers, which, as the United States’ Commission
suggests, may properly be described as “industrial feudalism.” It is not
easy to understand how the traditional liberties of Englishmen are
compatible with an organization of industry which, except in so far as
it has been qualified by the law or by trade unionism, permits
populations almost as large as those of some famous cities of the past
to be controlled in their rising up and lying down, in their work,
economic opportunities, and social life by the decisions of a Committee
of half-a-dozen Directors.</p>
<p>The most conservative thinkers recognize that the present
organization of industry is intolerable in the sacrifice of liberty
which it entails upon the producer. But each effort which he makes to
emancipate himself is met by a protest that, if the existing system is
incompatible with freedom, it at least secures efficient service, and
that efficient service is threatened by movements which aim at placing a
greater measure of industrial control in the hands of the workers. The
attempt to drive a wedge between the producer and the consumer is
obviously the cue of all the interests which are conscious that by
themselves they are unable to hold back the flood. It is natural,
therefore, that during the last two years they should have concentrated
their efforts upon representing that every advance in the demands and in
the power of any particular group of workers is a new imposition upon
the general body of the public Eminent persons, who are not obviously
producing more than they consume, explain to the working classes that
unless they produce more they must consume less. Highly syndicated
combinations warn the public against the menace of predatory
syndicalism. The owners of mines and minerals, in their new role as
protectors of the poor, lament the “selfishness” of the miners, as
though nothing but pure philanthropy had hitherto caused profits and
royalties to be reluctantly accepted by themselves.</p>
<p>The assumption upon which this body of argument rests is simple. It
is that the existing organization of industry is the safeguard of
productive efficiency, and that from every attempt to alter it the
workers themselves lose more as consumers than they can gain as
producers. The world has been drained of its wealth and demands
abundance of goods. The workers demand a larger income, greater leisure,
and a more secure and dignified status. These demands, it is argued, are
contradictory. For how can the consumer be supplied with cheap goods,
if, as a worker, he insists on higher wages and shorter hours? And how
can the worker secure these conditions, if as a consumer, he demands
cheap goods? So industry, it is thought, moves in a vicious circle of
shorter hours and higher wages and less production, which in time must
mean longer hours and lower wages; and every one receives less, because
every one demands more.</p>
<p>The picture is plausible, but it is fallacious. It is fallacious not
merely in its crude assumption that a rise in wages necessarily involves
an increase in costs, but for another and more fundamental reason. In
reality the cause of economic confusion is not that the demands of
producer and consumer meet in blunt opposition; for, if they did, their
incompatibility, when they were incompatible, would be obvious, and
neither could deny his responsibility to the other, however much he
might seek to evade it. It is that they do not, but that, as industry is
organized to-day, what the worker foregoes the general body of consumers
does not necessarily gain, and what the consumer pays the general body
of workers does not necessarily receive. If the circle is vicious, its
vice is not that it is closed, but that it is always half open, so that
part of production leaks away in consumption which adds nothing to
productive energies, and that the producer, because he knows this, does
not fully use even the productive energy which he commands.</p>
<p>It is the consciousness of this leak which sets every one at cross
purposes. No conceivable system of industrial organization can secure
industrial peace, if by “peace” is meant a complete absence of
disagreement. What could be secured would be that disagreements should
not flare up into a beacon of class warfare. If every member of a group
puts something into a common pool on condition of taking something out,
they may still quarrel about the size of the shares, as children quarrel
over cake; but, if the total is known and the claims admitted, that is
all they can quarrel about, and, since they all stand on the same
footing, any one who holds out for more than his fellows must show some
good reason why he should get it. But in industry the claims are not all
admitted, for those who put nothing in demand to take something out;
both the total to be divided and the proportion in which the division
takes place are sedulously concealed; and those who preside over the
distribution of the pool and control what is paid out of it have a
direct interest in securing as large a share as possible for themselves
and in allotting as small a share as possible to others. If one
contributor takes less, so far from it being evident that the gain will
go to some one who has put something in and has as good a right as
himself, it may go to some one who has put in nothing and has no right
at all. If another claims more, he may secure it, without plundering a
fellow-worker, at the expense of a sleeping partner who is believed to
plunder both. In practice, since there is no clear principle determining
what they ought to take, both take all they can get.</p>
<p>In such circumstances denunciations of the producer for exploiting
the consumer miss the mark. They are inevitably regarded as an economic
version of the military device used by armies which advance behind a
screen of women and children, and then protest at the brutality of the
enemy in shooting non-combatants. They are interpreted as evidence, not
that a section of the producers are exploiting the remainder, but that a
minority of property-owners, which is in opposition to both, can use its
economic power to make efforts directed against those who consume much
and produce little rebound on those who consume little and produce much.
And the grievance, of which the Press makes so much, that some workers
may be taking too large a share compared with others, is masked by the
much greater grievance, of which it says nothing whatever, that some
idlers take any share at all.</p>
<p>The abolition of payments which are made without any corresponding
economic service is thus one of the indispensable conditions both of
economic efficiency and industrial peace, because their existence
prevents different classes of workers from restraining each other, by
uniting them all against the common enemy. Either the principle of
industry is that of function, in which case slack work is only less
immoral than no work at all; or it is that of grab, in which case there
is no morality in the matter. But it cannot be both. And it is useless
either for property-owners or for Governments to lament the mote in the
eye of the trade unions, as long as, by insisting on the maintenance of
functionless property, they decline to remove the beam in their own.</p>
<p>The truth is that only workers can prevent the abuse of power by
workers, because only workers are recognized as possessing any title to
have their claims considered. And the first step to prevent the
exploitation of the consumer by the producer is simple. It is to turn
all men into producers, and thus to remove the temptation for particular
groups of workers to force their claims at the expense of the public, by
removing the valid excuse that such gains as they may get are taken from
those who at present have no right to them, because they are
disproportionate to service or obtained for no service at all. Indeed,
if work were the only title to payment, the danger of the community
being exploited by highly organized groups of producers would largely
disappear. For when no payments were made to non-producers, there would
be no debatable ground for which to struggle, and it would become
evident that if one group of producers took more, another must put up
with less.</p>
<p>Under such conditions a body of workers who used their strategic
position to extort extravagant terms for themselves at the expense of
their fellow-workers might properly be described as exploiting the
community. But at present such a statement is meaningless. -It is
meaningless because, before the community can be exploited, the
community must exist, and its existence in the sphere of economic
relations is to-day, not a fact, but only an aspiration. The procedure
by which, whenever any section of workers advance demands which are
regarded as inconvenient by their masters, they are denounced as a band
of anarchists who are preying on the public, may be a convenient weapon
in an emergency, but, once it is submitted to analysis, it is logically
self-destructive. It has been applied within recent years, to the
postmen, to the engineers, to the policemen, to the miners and to the
railway men, a population with their dependents, of some eight million
persons; and in the case of the last two the whole body of organized
labour made common cause with those of whose exorbitant demands it was
alleged to be the victim. But when these workers and their sympathizers
are deducted, what is “the community” which remains? It is a naive
arithmetic which produces a total by subtracting one by one all the
items which compose it; and the art which discovers the public interest
by eliminating the interests of successive sections of the public smacks
of the rhetorician rather than of the statesman.</p>
<p>The truth is that at present it is idle to seek to resist the demands
of any group of workers by appeals to “the interests of society,”
because today, as long as the economic plane alone is considered, there
is not one society but two, which dwell together in uneasy
juxtaposition, like Sinbad and the Old Man of the Sea, but which in
spirit, in ideals, and in economic interest, are worlds asunder. There
is the society of those who live by labour, whatever their craft or
profession, and the society of those who live on it. And the latter
cannot command the sacrifices or the loyalty which are due to the
former, for they have no title which will bear inspection.</p>
<p>The instinct to ignore that tragic division instead of ending it is
amiable, and sometimes generous. But it is a sentimentality which is
like the morbid optimism of the consumptive who dares not admit even to
himself the virulence of his disease. As long as the division exists,
the general body of workers, while it may suffer from the struggles of
any one group within it, nevertheless supports them by its sympathy,
because all are interested in the results of the contest carried on by
each. Different sections of workers will exercise mutual restraint only
when the termination of the struggle leaves them face to face with each
other, and not as now, with the common enemy. The ideal of a united
society in which no one group uses its power to encroach upon the
standards of another is, in short, unattainable, except through the
preliminary abolition of functionless property.</p>
<p>Those to whom a leisure class is part of an immutable order without
which civilization is inconceivable, dare not admit, even to themselves,
that the world is poorer, not richer, because of its existence. So,
when, as now, it is important that productive energy should be fully
used, they stamp and cry, and write to <em>The Times</em> about the
necessity for increased production, though all the time they themselves,
their way of life and expenditure, and their very existence as a leisure
class, are among the causes why production is not increased. In all
their economic plans they make one reservation, that, however
necessitous the world may be, it shall still support <em>them</em>. But
men who work do not make that reservation, nor is there any reason why
they should; and appeals to them to produce more wealth because the
public needs it usually fall upon deaf ears, even when such appeals are
not involved in the ignorance and misapprehensions which often
characterize them.</p>
<p>For the workman is not the servant of the consumer, for whose sake
the greater production is demanded, but of shareholders, whose primary
aim is dividends, and to whom all production, however futile or
frivolous, so long as it yields dividends, is the same. It is useless to
urge that he should produce more wealth for the community, unless at the
same time he is assured that it is the community which will benefit in
proportion as more wealth is produced. If every unnecessary charge upon
coal-getting had been eliminated, it would be reasonable to ask that the
miners should set a much needed example to the business community, by
refusing to extort better terms for themselves at the expense of the
public. But there is no reason why they should work for lower wages or
longer hours as long as those who are to-day responsible for the
management of the industry conduct it with “the extravagance and waste”
stigmatized by the most eminent official witness before the Coal
Commission, or why the consumer should grumble at the rapacity of the
miner as long as he allows himself to be mulcted by swollen profits, the
costs of an ineffective organization, and unnecessary payments to
superfluous middlemen.</p>
<p>If to-day the miner or any other workman produces more, he has no
guarantee that the result will be lower prices rather than higher
dividends and larger royalties, any more than, as a workman, he can
determine the quality of the wares which his employer supplies to
customers, or the price at which they are sold. Nor, as long as he is
directly the servant of a profit-making company, and only indirectly the
servant of the community, can any such guarantee be offered him. It can
be offered only in so far as he stands in an immediate and direct
relation to the public for whom industry is carried on, so that, when
all costs have been met,any surplus will pass to it, and not to private
individuals. It will be accepted only in so far as the workers in each
industry are not merely servants executing orders, but themselves have a
collective responsibility for the character of the service, and can use
their organizations, not merely to protect themselves against
exploitation, but to make positive contributions to the administration
and development of their industry.</p>

<section id="the-new-condition-of-efficiency" class="level1">
<h1>The New Condition of Efficiency</h1>
<p>Thus it is not only for the sake of the producers, on whom the old
industrial order weighed most heavily, that a new industrial order is
needed. It is needed for the sake of the consumers, because the ability
on which the old industrial order prided itself most and which is
flaunted most as an argument against change, the ability to serve them
effectively, is itself visibly breaking down. It is breaking down at
what was always its most vulnerable point, the control of the human
beings whom, with characteristic indifference to all but their economic
significance, it distilled for its own purposes into an abstraction
called “Labour.” The first symptom of its collapse is what the first
symptom of economic collapses has usually been in the past—the failure
of customary stimuli to evoke their customary response in human
effort.</p>
<section id="a-the-passing-of-authority-from-the-capitalist" class="level2">
<h2>(a) The Passing of Authority from the Capitalist</h2>
<p>Till that failure is recognized and industry reorganized so that new
stimuli may have free play, the collapse will not correct itself, but,
doubtless with spasmodic revivals and flickering energy, will continue
and accelerate. The cause of it is simple. It is that those whose
business it is to direct economic activity are increasingly incapable of
directing the men upon whom economic activity depends. The fault is not
that of individuals, but of a system, of Industrialism itself. During
the greater part of the nineteenth century industry was driven by two
forces, hunger and fear, and the employer commanded them both. He could
grant or withhold employment as he pleased. If men revolted against his
terms he could dismiss them, and, if they were dismissed, what
confronted them was starvation or the workhouse. Authority was
centralized; its instruments were passive; the one thing which they
dreaded was unemployment. And since they could neither prevent its
occurrence nor do more than a little to mitigate its horrors when it
occurred, they submitted to a discipline which they could not resist,
and industry pursued its course through their passive acquiescence in a
power which could crush them individually if they attempted to oppose
it.</p>
<p>That system might be lauded as efficient or denounced as inhuman.
But, at least, as its admirers were never tired of pointing out, it
worked. And, like the Prussian State, which alike in its virtues and
deficiencies it not a little resembled, as long as it worked it survived
denunciations of its methods, as a strong man will throw off a disease.
But to-day it is ceasing to have even the qualities of its defects. It
is ceasing to be efficient. It no longer secures the ever-increasing
output of wealth which it offered in its golden prime, and which enabled
it to silence criticism by an imposing spectacle of material success.
Though it still works, it works unevenly, amid constant friction and
jolts and stoppages, without the confidence of the public and without
full confidence even in itself. It is a tyrant who must intrigue and
cajole where formerly he commanded, a gaoler who, if not yet deprived of
the whip, dare only administer moderate chastisement, and who, though he
still protests that he alone can keep the treadmill moving and get the
corn ground, is compelled to surrender so much of his authority as to
make it questionable whether he is worth his keep.</p>
<p>For the instruments through which Capitalism exercised discipline are
one by one being taken from it. It cannot pay what wages it likes or
work what hours it likes. For several years it has been obliged to
accept the control of prices and profits. In well-organized industries
the power of arbitrary dismissal, the very centre of its authority, is
being shaken, because men will no longer tolerate a system which makes
their livelihood dependent on the caprices of an individual. In all
industries alike the time is not far distant when the dread of
starvation can no longer be used to cow dissatisfied workers into
submission, because the public will no longer allow involuntary
unemployment to result in starvation.</p>
<p>The last point is of crucial importance. It is the control of the
workers’ will through the control of his livelihood which has been in
the past the master weapon of economic tyranny. Both its champions and
its opponents know it. In 1919, when the world of Labour was in motion,
there were some employers who looked to the inevitable recurrence of bad
trade “to teach them reason.” Now that bad trade has come, and with it
the misery of unemployment, there are some employers who say that the
immediate loss will be more than counter balanced if the lesson which
the older generation had learned, and which was half forgotten during
the war, is impressed upon the young men who grew up between 1914 and
1920. Let them once realise what it is not to be wanted, and, except for
an occasional outburst, they will come to heel for the rest of their
lives.</p>
<p>The calculation is superficial, since the fear of unemployment is one
potent cause of industrial <em>malaise</em> and of the slackening of
production. The building operative whose job is drawing towards its
close, and who in the past has had to tramp the streets for months in
search of another, may think that he has a duty to his employer, but he
reflects that he has a prior duty to his wife and children. So he “makes
the job last”; and he is right. As an expedient for the moment, however,
unemployment may be an effective weapon—provided that the young men will
follow their fathers’ example, and treat it as the act of God, not as a
disease accompanying a particular type of industrial organization. But
will they? It is too early yet to answer that question. It seems clear,
however, that the whole repulsive body of assumptions, which made it
seem natural to use the mass of workers as instruments to be picked up
when there was work and to be laid aside when there was not, is finding
increasing difficulty in meeting the criticism directed against it. In
the impressive words of Lord Shaw, “if men were merely the spare parts
of an industrial machine, this callous reckoning might be appropriate;
but Society will not much longer tolerate the employment of human beings
on those lines.”</p>
<p>What the trade unions are beginning to demand, and what they are
likely to demand with increasing insistence in the future, is that their
members shall be treated as “on the strength” of their respective
industries, and that, if an industry requires workers when it is busy,
it shall accumulate in good times the reserves needed to maintain those
workers when it is slack. The Building Guilds have adopted that
principle. The Committee of employers and trade unionists presided over
by Mr. Foster recommended a scheme which was, in essence, the same. The
striking programme submitted by Mr. Bevin to the Transport Workers’
Federation proposes that the whole of the 125,000 workers to be
registered as members of the industry shall be guaranteed a regular wage
of £4 a week throughout the year, provided they present themselves for
employment, and that the cost shall be met by a levy of 4d. a ton on
imports and exports. The provisions for “contracting out” under the
Unemployment Insurance Act, unsatisfactory though they are, are a step
towards the adoption of schemes which will treat the payment of regular
wages to the workers in each industry, work or play, as part of the
normal “costs” which the return to the industry must cover. Now that the
principle of maintenance has been recognised, however inadequately, by
legislation, its application is likely to be extended from the exiguous
benefit at present provided to the payment of a sum which will, in
effect, be a standing wage, payable in bad times as in good, to all
workers normally engaged in each industry.</p>
<p>In proportion as that result is achieved, Capitalism will be unable
to appeal to the terror of unemployment which has been in the past its
most powerful instrument of economic discipline. And its prestige will
vanish with its power. Indeed it is vanishing already. For if Capitalism
is losing its control of men’s bodies, still more has it lost its
command of their minds. The product of a civilization which regarded
“the poor” as the instruments, at worst of the luxuries, at best of the
virtues, of the rich, its psychological foundation fifty years ago was
an ignorance in the mass of mankind which led them to reverence as
wisdom the very follies of their masters, and an almost animal
incapacity for responsibility. Education and experience have destroyed
the passivity which was the condition of the perpetuation of industrial
government in the hands of an oligarchy of private capitalists. The
workman of to-day has as little belief in the intellectual superiority
of many of those who direct industry as he has in the morality of the
system. It appears to him to be not only oppressive, but wasteful,
unintelligent and inefficient. In the light of his own experience in the
factory and the mine, he regards the claim of the capitalist to be the
self-appointed guardian of public interests as a piece of sanctimonious
hypocrisy. For he sees every day that efficiency is sacrificed to
short-sighted financial interests; and while as a man he is outraged by
the inhumanity of the industrial order, as a professional who knows the
difference between good work and bad he has a growing contempt at once
for its misplaced parsimony and its misplaced extravagance, for the
whole apparatus of adulteration, advertisement and quackery which seems
inseparable from the pursuit of profit as the main standard of
industrial success.</p>
<p>So Capitalism no longer secures strenuous work by fear, for it is
ceasing to be formidable. And it cannot secure it by respect, for it has
ceased to be respected. And the very victories by which it seeks to
reassert its waning prestige are more disastrous than defeats. Employers
may congratulate themselves that they have maintained intact their right
to freedom of management, or opposed successfully a demand for public
ownership, or broken a movement for higher wages and shorter hours. But
what is success in a trade dispute or in a political struggle is often a
defeat in the workshop. The workmen may have lost, but it does not
follow that their employers, still less that the public, which is
principally composed of workmen, have won.</p>
<p>For the object of industry is to produce goods, and to produce them
at the lowest cost in human effort. But there is no alchemy which will
secure efficient production from the resentment or distrust of men who
feel contempt for the order under which they work. It is a commonplace
that credit is the foundation of industry. But credit is a matter of
psychology, and the workman has his psychology as well as the
capitalist. If confidence is necessary to the investment of capital,
confidence is not less necessary to the effective performance of labour
by men whose sole livelihood depends upon it. If they are not yet strong
enough to impose their will, they are strong enough to resist when their
masters would impose theirs. They may work rather than strike. But they
will work to escape dismissal, not for the greater glory of a system in
which they do not believe; and, if they are dismissed, those who take
their place will do the same.</p>
<p>That this is one cause of a low output has “been stated both by
employers and workers in the building industry, and by the
representatives of the miners before the Coal Commission. It was
reiterated with impressive emphasis by Mr. Justice Sankey. Nor is it
seriously contested by employers themselves. What else, indeed, do their
repeated denunciations of”restriction of output” mean, except that they
have failed to organize industry so as to secure the efficient service
which it is their special function to provide? Nor is it appropriate to
the situation to indulge in full-blooded denunciations of the
“selfishness” of the working classes. “To draw an indictment against a
whole nation” is a procedure which is as impossible in industry as it is
in politics. Institutions must be adapted to human nature, not human
nature to institutions. If the effect of the industrial system is such
that a large and increasing number of ordinary men and women find that
it offers them no adequate motive for economic effort, it is mere
pedantry to denounce men and women instead of amending the system.</p>
<p>Thus the time has come when absolutism in industry may still win its
battles, but loses the campaign, and loses it on the very ground of
economic efficiency which was of its own selection. In the period of
transition, while economic activity is distracted by the struggle
between those who have the name and habit of power, but no longer the
full reality of it, and those who are daily winning more of the reality
of power but are not yet its recognized repositories, it is the consumer
who suffers. He has neither the service of docile obedience, nor the
service of intelligent co-operation. For slavery will work—as long as
the slaves will let it; and freedom will work when men have learned to
be free; but what will not work is a combination of the two. So the
public goes short of coal, not only because of the technical
deficiencies of the system under which it is raised and distributed, but
because the system itself has lost its driving force—because the mine
owners can no longer persuade the miners into producing more dividends
for themselves and more royalties for the owners of minerals, while the
public cannot appeal to them to put their whole power into serving
itself, because it has chosen that they should be the servants, not of
itself, but of shareholders.</p>
<p>And this dilemma is not, as some suppose, temporary, the aftermath of
war, or peculiar to the coal industry, as though the miners alone were
the children of sin which in the last two years they have been described
to be. It is permanent; it has spread far; and, as sleeping spirits are
stirred into life by education and one industry after another develops a
strong corporate consciousness, it will spread further. Nor will it be
resolved by lamentations or menaces or denunciations of leaders whose
only significance is that they say openly what plain men feel privately.
For the matter at bottom is one of psychology. What has happened is that
the motives on which the industrial system relied for several
generations to secure efficiency, secure it no longer. And it is as
impossible to restore them, to revive by mere exhortation the complex of
hopes and fears and ignorance and patient credulity and passive
acquiescence, which together made men, fifty years ago, plastic
instruments in the hands of industrialism, as to restore innocence to
any others of those who have eaten of the tree of knowledge.</p>
<p>The ideal of some intelligent and respectable business men, the
restoration of the golden sixties, when workmen were docile and
confiding, and trade unions were still half illegal, and foreign
competition meant English competition in foreign countries, and prices
were rising a little and not rising too much, is the one Utopia which
can never be realized. The King may walk naked as long as his courtiers
protest that he is clad; but when a child or a fool has broken the spell
a tailor is more important than all their admiration. If the public,
which suffers from the slackening of economic activity, desires to end
its <em>malaise</em>, it will not laud as admirable and all-sufficient
the operation of motives which are plainly ceasing to move. It will seek
to liberate new motives and to enlist them in its service. It will
endeavour to find an alternative to incentives which were always
degrading, to those who used them as much as to those upon whom they
were used, and which now are adequate incentives no longer. And the
alternative to the discipline which Capitalism exercised through its
instruments of unemployment and starvation is the self-discipline of
responsibility and professional pride.</p>
<p>So the demand which aims at stronger organization, fuller
responsibility, larger powers for the sake of the producer as a
condition of economic liberty, the demand for freedom, is not antithetic
to the demand for more effective work and increased output which is
being made in the interests of the consumer. It is complementary to it,
as the insistence by a body of professional men, whether doctors or
university teachers, on the maintenance of their professional
independence and dignity against attempts to cheapen the service is not
hostile to an efficient service, but, in the long run, a condition of
it.</p>
<p>The course of wisdom for the consumer would be to hasten, so far as
he can, the transition. For, as at present conducted, industry is
working against the grain. It is compassing sea and land in its efforts
to overcome, by ingenious financial and technical expedients, obstacles
which should never have existed. It is trying to produce its results by
conquering professional feeling instead of by using it. It is carrying
not only its inevitable economic burdens, but an ever increasing load of
ill-will and scepticism. It has, in fact, “shot the bird which caused
the wind to blow” and goes about its business with the corpse round its
neck. Compared with that psychological incubus, the technical
deficiencies of industry, serious though they often are, are a
bagatelle, and the business men who preach the gospel of production
without offering any plan for dealing with what is now the central fact
in the economic situation, resemble a Christian apologist who should
avoid disturbing the equanimity of his audience by carefully omitting
all reference either to the fall of man or to the scheme of salvation.
If it is desired to increase the output of wealth, it is not a paradox,
but the statement of an elementary economic truism to say that active
and constructive co-operation on the part of the rank and file of
workers would do more to contribute to that result than the discovery of
a new coalfield or a generation of scientific invention.</p>
</section>
<section id="b-the-appeal-to-professional-feeling" class="level2">
<h2>(b) The Appeal to Professional Feeling</h2>
<p>The first condition of enlisting on the side of constructive work the
professional feeling which is now apathetic, or even hostile to it, is
to secure that, when it is given, its results accrue to the public, not
to the owner of property in capital, in land, or in other resources. For
this reason the attenuation of the rights at present involved in the
private ownership of industrial capital, or their complete abolition, is
not the demand of ideologues, but an indispensable element in a policy
of economic efficiency, since it is the condition of the most effective
functioning of the human beings upon whom, though, like other truisms,
it is often forgotten, economic efficiency ultimately depends. But it is
only one element. Co-operation may range from mere acquiescence to a
vigilant and zealous initiative. The criterion of an effective system of
administration is that it should succeed in enlisting in the conduct of
industry the latent forces of professional pride to which the present
industrial order makes little appeal, and which, indeed. Capitalism, in
its war upon trade union organization, endeavoured for many years to
stamp out altogether.</p>
<p>Nor does the efficacy of such an appeal repose upon the assumption of
that “change in human nature,” which is the triumphant <em>reductio ad
absurdum</em> advanced by those who are least satisfied with the working
of human nature as it is. What it does involve is that certain
elementary facts should be taken into account, instead of, as at
present, being ignored. That all work is distasteful, and that “every
man desires to secure the largest income with the least effort,” may be
as axiomatic as it is assumed to be. But in practice it makes all the
difference to the attitude of the individual whether the collective
sentiment of the group to which he belongs is on the side of effort or
against it, and what standard of effort it sets. That, as employers
complain, the public opinion of considerable groups of workers is
against an intensification of effort as long as part of its result is
increased dividends for shareholders, is, no doubt, as far as mere
efficiency is concerned, the gravest indictment of the existing
industrial order. But, even when public ownership has taken the place of
private capitalism, its ability to command effective service will depend
ultimately upon its success in securing, not merely that professional
feeling is no longer an opposing force, but that it is actively enlisted
upon the side of maintaining the highest possible standard of efficiency
which can reasonably be demanded.</p>
<p>To put the matter concretely, while the existing ownership of mines
is a positive inducement to inefficient work, public ownership
administered by a bureaucracy, if it would remove the technical
deficiencies emphasized by Sir Richard Redmayne as inseparable from the
separate administration of 3,000 pits by 1,500 different companies,
would be only too likely to miss a capital advantage which a different
type of administration would secure. It would lose both the assistance
to be derived from the technical knowledge of practical men who know by
daily experience the points at which the details of administration can
be improved, and the stimulus to efficiency springing from the corporate
pride of a profession which is responsible for maintaining and improving
the character of its service.</p>
<p>Professional spirit is a force like gravitation, which in itself is
neither good nor bad, but which the engineer uses, when he can, to do
his work for him. If it is foolish to idealize it, it is equally
short-sighted to neglect it. In what are described <em>par
excellence</em> as “the services” it has always been recognized that
<em>esprit de corps</em> is the foundation of efficiency, and all means,
some wise and some mischievous, are used to encourage it; in practice,
indeed, the power upon which the country relied as its main safeguard in
an emergency was the professional zeal of the navy and nothing else. Nor
is that spirit peculiar to the professions which are concerned with war.
It is a matter of common training, common responsibilities, and common
dangers. In all cases where difficult and disagreeable work is to be
done, the force which elicits it is normally not merely money, but the
public opinion and tradition of the little society in which the
individual moves, and in the esteem of which he finds that which men
value in success.</p>
<p>To ignore that most powerful of stimuli as it is ignored to-day, and
then to lament that the efforts which it produces are not forthcoming,
is the height of perversity. To aim at eliminating from industry the
growth and action of corporate feeling, for fear lest an organized body
of producers should exploit the public, is a plausible policy. But it is
short-sighted. It is “to pour away the baby with the bath,” and to lower
the quality of the service in an attempt to safeguard it. A wise system
of administration would recognize that professional solidarity can do
much of its work for it more effectively than it can do it itself,
because the spirit of his profession is part of the individual and not a
force outside him, and it would make it its object to enlist that temper
in the public service. It is only by that policy, indeed, that the
elaboration of cumbrous regulations to prevent men doing what they
should not, with the incidental result of sometimes preventing them from
doing what they should—it is only by that policy that what is mechanical
and obstructive in bureaucracy can be averted. For industry cannot run
without laws. It must either control itself by professional standards,
or it must be controlled by officials who are not of the craft, and who,
however zealous and well-meaning, can hardly have the feel of it in
their fingers. Public control and criticism are indispensable. But they
should not be too detailed, or they defeat themselves. It would be
better that, once fair standards have been established, the professional
organization should check offences against prices and quality than that
it should be necessary for the State to do so. The alternative to minute
external supervision is supervision from within by men who become imbued
with the public obligations of their trade in the very process of
learning it. It is, in short, professionalism in industry.</p>
<p>For this reason collectivism by itself is too simple a solution. Its
failure is likely to be that of other rationalist systems.</p>
<blockquote>
<p> “Dann hat er die Theile in seiner Hand,</p>
<p>Fehlt leider! nur das geistige Band.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If industrial reorganization is to be a living reality, and not
merely a plan upon paper, its aim must be to secure not only that
industry is carried on for the service of the public, but that it shall
be carried on with the active co-operation of the organizations of
producers. But co-operation involves responsibility, and responsibility
involves power. It is idle to expect that men will give their best to
any system which they do not trust, or that they will trust any system
in the control of which they do not share. Their ability to carry
professional obligations depends upon the power which they possess to
remove the obstacles which prevent those obligations from being
discharged, and upon their willingness, when they possess the power, to
use it.</p>
<p>Two causes appear to have hampered the committees which were
established in connection with coal mines during the war to increase the
output of coal. One was the reluctance of some of them to discharge the
invidious task of imposing penalties for absenteeism on their
fellow-workmen. The other was the exclusion of faults of management from
the control of many committees. In some cases all went well till they
demanded that, if the miners were penalized for absenteeism which was
due to them, the management should be penalized similarly when men who
desired to work were sent home, because, as the result of defective
organization, there was no work for them to do. Their demand was
resisted as “interference with the management,” and the attempt to
enforce regularity of attendance broke down. Nor, to take another
example from the same industry, is it to be expected that the weight of
the miners’ organization will be thrown on to the side of greater
production, if it has no power to insist on the removal of the defects
of equipment and organization, the shortage of trams, rails, tubs and
timber, the “creaming” of the pits by the working of easily got coal to
their future detriment, their wasteful lay-out caused by the vagaries of
separate ownership, by which at present the output is reduced.</p>
<p>The public cannot have it both ways. If it allows workmen to be
treated as “hands”, it cannot claim the service of their wills and their
brains. If it desires them to show the zeal of skilled professionals, it
must secure that they have sufficient power to allow of their
discharging professional responsibilities. In order that workmen may
abolish any restrictions on output which may be imposed by them, they
must be able to insist on the abolition of the restrictions, more
mischievous because more effective, which, as the Committee on Trusts
has recently told us, are imposed by organizations of employers. In
order that the miners’ leaders, instead of merely bargaining as to
wages, hours and working conditions, may be able to appeal to their
members to increase the supply of coal, they must be in a position to
secure the removal of the causes of low output which are due to the
deficiencies of the management, and which are to-day a far more serious
obstacle than any reluctance on the part of the miner. If the workmen in
the building trades are to take combined action to accelerate
production, they must as a body be consulted as to the purpose to which
their energy is to be applied, and must not be expected to build
fashionable houses, when what are required are six-roomed cottages to
house families which are at present living three persons to a room.</p>
<p>It is deplorable, indeed, that any human beings should consent to
degrade themselves by producing the articles which a considerable number
of workmen turn out to-day, boots which are partly brown paper, and
furniture which is not fit to use. The revenge of outraged humanity is
certain, though it is not always obvious; and the penalty paid by the
consumer for tolerating an organization of industry which, in the name
of efficiency, destroyed the responsibility of the workman, is that the
service with which he is provided is not even efficient. He has always
paid it, though he has not seen it, in quality. To-day he is beginning
to realize that he is likely to pay it in quantity as well. If the
public is to get efficient service, it can get it only from human
beings, with the initiative and caprices of human beings. It will get
it, in short, in so far as it treats industry as a responsible
profession.</p>
<p>The collective responsibility of the workers for the maintenance of
the standards of their profession is, then, the alternative to the
discipline which Capitalism exercised in the past, and which is now
breaking down. It involves a fundamental change in the position both of
employers and of trade unions. As long as the direction of industry is
in the hands of property-owners or their agents, who are concerned to
extract from it the maximum profit for themselves, a trade union is
necessarily a defensive organization. Absorbed, on the one hand, in the
struggle to resist the downward thrust of Capitalism upon the workers’
standard of life, and denounced, on the other, if it presumes, to
“interfere with management,” even when management is most obviously
inefficient, it is an opposition which never becomes a government, and
which has neither the will nor the power to assume responsibility for
the quality of the service offered to the consumer. If the abolition of
functionless property transferred the control of production to bodies
representing those who performed constructive work and those who
consumed the goods produced, the relation of the worker to the public
would no longer be indirect but immediate. Associations which are now
purely defensive would be in a position, not merely to criticize and
oppose, but to advise, to initiate and to enforce upon their own members
the obligations of the craft.</p>
</section>
<section id="c-the-need-of-a-new-economic-psychology" class="level2">
<h2>(c) The need of a new Economic Psychology</h2>
<p>It is obvious that in such circumstances the service offered the
consumer, however carefully safeguarded by his representation on the
authorities controlling each industry, would depend primarily upon the
success of professional organizations in finding a substitute for the
discipline exercised to-day by the agents of property-owners. It would
be necessary for them to maintain by their own action the zeal,
efficiency and professional pride which, when the barbarous weapons of
the nineteenth century have been discarded, would be the only guarantee
of a high level of production. Nor, once this new function has been made
possible for professional organizations, is there any extravagance in
expecting them to perform it with reasonable competence.</p>
<p>How far economic motives are baulked to-day and could be strengthened
by a different type of industrial organization, to what extent, and
under what conditions, it is possible to enlist in the services of
industry motives which are not purely economic, can be ascertained only
after a study of the psychology of work which has not yet been made.
Such a study, to be of value, must start by abandoning the conventional
assumptions, popularized by economic textbooks and accepted as
self-evident by practical men, that the motives to effort are simple and
constant in character, like the pressure of steam in a boiler, that they
are identical throughout all ranges of economic activity, from the stock
exchange to the shunting of wagons or the laying of bricks, and that
they can be elicited and strengthened only by directly economic
incentives.</p>
<p>In so far as motives in industry have been considered hitherto, it
has usually been done by writers who, like most exponents of scientific
management, have started by assuming that the categories of business
psychology could be applied with equal success to all classes of workers
and to all types of productive work. Those categories appear to be
derived from a simplified analysis of the mental processes of the
company promoter, financier or investor, and their validity as an
interpretation of the motives and habits which determine the attitude to
his work of the bricklayer, the miner, the dock labourer or the
engineer, is precisely the point in question.</p>
<p>Clearly there are certain types of industry to which they are only
partially relevant. It can hardly be assumed, for example, that the
degree of skill and energy brought to his work by a surgeon, a
scientific investigator, a teacher, a medical officer of health, an
Indian civil servant and a peasant proprietor are capable of being
expressed precisely and to the same degree in terms of the economic
advantage which those different occupations offer. Obviously those who
pursue them are influenced to some considerable, though uncertain,
extent by economic incentives. Obviously, again, the precise character
of each process or step in the exercise of their respective avocations,
the performance of an operation, the carrying out of a piece of
investigation, the selection of a particular type of educational method,
the preparation of a report, the decision of a case or the care of live
stock, is not immediately dependent upon an exact calculation of
pecuniary gain or loss.</p>
<p>What appears to be the case is that in certain walks of life, while
the occupation is chosen after a consideration of its economic
advantages, and while economic reasons exact the minimum degree of
activity needed to avert dismissal from it or “failure,” the actual
level of energy or proficiency displayed depends largely upon conditions
of a different order. Among them are the character of the training
received before and after entering the occupation, the customary
standard of effort demanded by the public opinion of one’s fellows, the
desire for the esteem of the small circle in which the individual moves,
the wish to be recognized as having “made good” and not to have
“failed,” interest in one’s work, ranging from devotion to a
determination to “do justice” to it, the pride of the craftsman, the
“tradition of the service.”</p>
<p>It would be foolish to suggest that any considerable body of men are
uninfluenced by economic considerations. But to represent them as
amenable to such incentives only is to give a quite unreal and bookish
picture of the actual conditions under which the work of the world is
carried on. How large a part such considerations play varies from one
occupation to another, according to the character of the work which it
does and the manner in which it is organized. In what is called <em>par
excellence</em> industry, calculations of pecuniary gain and loss are
more powerful than in most of the so-called professions, though even in
industry they are more constantly present to the minds of the business
men who “direct” it, than to those of the managers and technicians, most
of whom are paid fixed salaries, or to the rank and file of
wage-earners. In the professions of teaching and medicine, and in many
branches of the public service, the necessary qualities are secured,
without the intervention of the capitalist employer, partly by pecuniary
incentives, partly by training and education, partly by the acceptance
on the part of those entering them of the traditional obligations of
their profession as a part of the normal framework of their working
lives. But this difference is not constant and unalterable. It springs
from the manner in which different types of occupation are organized, on
the training which they offer, and on the <em>morale</em> which they
cultivate among their members. The psychology of a vocation can in fact
be changed; new motives can be elicited, provided steps are taken to
allow them free expression. It is as feasible to turn building into an
organized profession, with a relatively high code of public honour, as
it was to do the same for medicine or teaching.</p>
<p>Suppose that the technical heads of a great industry, like mining or
building, having undergone some kind of conversion, should decide to
throw in their lot with the workers in it, and should take thought with
them, and with representatives of the consumers, as to the ways of
securing in future the most effective service with the least economic
compulsion. How would they proceed? Well, clearly, in the first place,
they would lay immense stress upon training and selection. Quite apart
from the universal secondary education which ought to be provided for
all children up to sixteen—in place of the miserable trickle of less
than 5% of the boys and girls leaving the elementary schools who enter
secondary schools to-day, only to leave them again, in the majority of
cases, soon after their fifteenth birthday—quite apart from the general
and communal system of higher education, they would develop a special
type of training for the youths from whom the future recruits of the
service would be drawn.</p>
<p>It would be partly a training in a specialized technique, like that
given in Schools of Mining—the nucleus of such a system for the mining
industry—at the present day. But it would be even more a discipline in
professional ethics. It would aim at driving home, as a fixed habit, a
certain standard of professional conduct. It would emphasize that there
were certain things—like advertising, or accepting secret commissions,
or taking advantage of a client’s ignorance, or rigging the market, or
other analogous practices of the present commercial world—which “the
service can’t do.” It would cultivate the <em>esprit de corps</em> which
is natural to young men, and would make them feel that to snatch special
advantages for oneself, like any common business man, is, apart from
other considerations, an odious offence against good manners. And since
the disposition of all occupations—the “trades” quite as much as the
“professions”—is to relapse into well-worn ruts and to make an idol of
good average mediocrity, it would impress upon them—what is one of the
main truths of all education whatsoever—that, if the young are not
always right, the old are nearly always wrong, and that the first duty
of youth is, not to avoid mistakes, but to show initiative and take
responsibility, to make a tradition not to perpetuate one.</p>
<p>From such professional schools, working in close conjunction with the
Universities, would come the candidates for admission to the profession.
The method of their selection would be as different from that which
obtains at present as would their training. There would be no question,
of course, of giving a soft job to the youth with money or influence,
still less of “picking the cheapest.” They would obtain, at the end of
their period of training, diplomas or other professional qualifications,
would spend the necessary number of years in practical work, and would
be engaged on the basis of their records. Once in the service, they
would be members of a profession from which the grosser indignities of
the present industrial world, the beating down of salaries and wages,
threats of arbitrary dismissal and involuntary unemployment without
payment, nepotism and jobbery, the insolence of rich men and their
servants, would be excluded. Since the higher posts would be recruited
by ability, not, as now in the Civil Service, by seniority, nor by what
is worse, the favouritism common in private business, every able man
would “carry a marshal’s baton in his haversack.” If the pecuniary value
of the largest prizes were reduced, the stimulus offered to the common
man would be enormously increased, since he would know that it depended
on himself to win them. The motive of fear might be weaker than it is
to-day, but the motive of hope would be infinitely stronger.</p>
<p>But knowledge is as important as zeal, and when “the nose for money”
is no longer regarded as a virtue, it will become all-important. The
profession would therefore have attached to it a body of experts,
engaged not in practising it, but in research into its problems. It
would be their business to pioneer and investigate, to produce new ideas
and to bring them to the notice of the practical men, to improve
established methods, to disturb complacent conservatism and to keep the
profession intellectually alive by a fresh current of criticism and
suggestion. Their discoveries would be public; there would be no corner
in knowledge, such as appears to be desired by the commercial gentlemen
who to-day wish to keep secret the discoveries of the State-supported
Bureau of Industrial Research. The consumers, who would have
representation on the bodies governing the industry, in the manner
proposed (for example) by Mr. Justice Sankey and the Miners’ Federation,
would be able to appeal to their results as evidence that a change of
methods, which the profession might dislike, was justified by the
increase in economy or efficiency which it would produce.</p>
<p>Is it unreasonable to suggest that such a combination of intellectual
and moral training, professional pride, and organized knowledge would be
at least as effective an economic engine as the struggle for personal
gain which at present drives the wheels of industry? That question has
hardly been discussed by economists. For economic science has never
escaped from the peculiar bias received from the dogmatic rationalism
which presided at its birth. Man seeks pleasure and shuns pain. He
desires riches and hates effort. A simple, yet delicate, hedonistic
calculus resides in the bosom of “employer” and “labourer”; to that they
will respond with the precision of a needle to the magnetic pole, and
they will respond to nothing else. That doctrine has been expelled from
psychology and political science: the danger to-day is that these
studies should lay too little stress upon reason, not too much, and
forget that, however unreasonable human beings may be proved to be, the
principal moral to be drawn is that at any rate they should be as
reasonable as they can. But mere crude eighteenth century rationalism
still works havoc with the discussion of economic issues, and, above
all, of industrial organization. It is still used as a lazy substitute
for observation, and to suggest a simplicity of motive which is quite
foreign to the facts.</p>
<p>All that type of thought belongs to the dark ages. The truth is that
we ought radically to revise the presuppositions as to human motives on
which current presentations of economic theory are ordinarily founded,
and in terms of which the discussion of economic questions is usually
carried on. The assumption that the stimulus of imminent personal want
is either the only spur, or a sufficient spur, to productive effort is a
relic of a crude psychology which has little warrant either in past
history or in present experience. It derives what plausibility it
possesses from a confusion between work in the sense of the lowest
<em>quantum</em> of activity needed to escape actual starvation, and the
work which is given, irrespective of the fact that elementary wants may
already have been satisfied, through the natural disposition of ordinary
men to maintain, and of extraordinary men to improve upon, the level of
exertion accepted as reasonable by the public opinion of the group of
which they are members. It is the old difference, forgotten by society
as often as it is learned, between the labour of the free man and that
of the slave. Economic fear may secure the minimum effort needed to
escape economic penalties. What, however, has made progress possible in
the past, and what, it may be suggested, matters to the world to-day, is
not the bare minimum which is required to avoid actual want, but the
capacity of men to bring to bear upon their tasks a degree of energy,
which, while it can be stimulated by economic incentives, yields results
far in excess of any which are necessary merely to avoid the extremes of
hunger or destitution.</p>
<p>That capacity is a matter of training, tradition and habit, at least
as much as of pecuniary stimulus, and the ability to raise it of a
professional association representing the public opinion of a group of
workers is, therefore, considerable. Once industry has been liberated
from its subservience to the interests of the functionless
property-owner, it is in this sphere that trade unions may be expected
increasingly to find their functions. Its importance both for the
general interests of the community and for the special interests of
particular groups of workers can hardly be exaggerated. Technical
knowledge and managerial skill are likely to be available as readily for
a committee appointed by the workers in an industry as for a committee
appointed, as now, by the shareholders. But it is more and more evident
to-day that the crux of the economic situation is not the technical
deficiencies of industrial organization, but the growing inability of
those who direct industry to command the active good will of the
<em>personnel</em>. Their co-operation is promised by the conversion of
industry into a profession serving the public, and promised, as far as
can be judged, by that alone.</p>
<p>Nor is the assumption of the new and often disagreeable obligations
of internal discipline and public responsibility one which trade
unionism can afford, once the change is accomplished, to shirk, however
alien they may be to its present traditions. For ultimately, if by slow
degrees, power follows the ability to wield it; authority goes with
function.</p>
<p>The workers cannot have it both ways. They must choose whether to
assume the responsibility for industrial discipline and become free, or
to repudiate it and continue to be serfs. If, organized as professional
bodies, they can provide a more effective service than that which is
now, with increasing difficulty, extorted by the agents of capital, they
will have made good their hold upon the future. If they cannot, they
will remain among the less calculable instruments of production which
many of them are to-day. The instinct of mankind warns it against
accepting at their face value spiritual demands which cannot justify
themselves by practical achievements. And the road along which the
organized workers, like any other class, must climb to power, starts
from the provision of a more effective economic service than their
masters, as their grip upon industry becomes increasingly vacillating
and uncertain, are able to supply.</p>

<h1>The Position of the Brain Worker</h1>
<section id="a-the-growth-of-an-intellectual-proletariat" class="level2">
<h2>(a) The Growth of an Intellectual Proletariat</h2>
<p>The conversion of industry into a profession will involve at least as
great a change in the position of the management as in that of the
manual workers. As each industry is organized for the performance of
function, the employer will cease to be a profit maker and become what,
in so far as he holds his position by a reputable title, he already is,
one workman among others.</p>
<p>In some industries, where the capitalist is a manager as well, the
alteration may take place through such a limitation of his interest as a
capitalist as it has been proposed by employers and workers to introduce
into the building industry. In others, where the whole work of
administration rests on the shoulders of salaried managers, it has
already in part been carried out. The economic conditions of this change
have, indeed, been prepared by the separation of ownership from
management, and by the growth of an intellectual proletariat to whom the
scientific and managerial work of industry is increasingly entrusted.
The concentration of businesses, the elaboration of organization, and
the developments springing from the application of science to industry
have resulted in the multiplication of a body of industrial brain
workers, whose existence makes the old classifications into “employers
and workmen,” which is still current in common speech, an absurdly
misleading description of the industrial system as it exists to-day.</p>
<p>This growth of a class of managers, under-managers, experts, and
technicians, who do an ever-increasing part of the scientific and
constructive work of industry, but who have no voice in its government,
and normally no share in its profits, is one of the most impressive
economic developments of the last thirty years. It marks the emergence
within the very heart of capitalist industry of a force which, both in
status and in economic interest, is allied to the wage-earners rather
than to the property-owners, and the support of which is, nevertheless,
vital to the continuance of the existing order. Almost the most
important industrial question of the immediate future is in what
direction it will throw its weight. So far as can be judged at present,
the salaried brain-workers appear to be undergoing the same gradual
conversion to a cautious and doctrineless trade unionism as took place
among the manual workers in the nineteenth century. Mine-managers,
under-managers, and surveyors all have their trade unions. The Railway
Clerks’ Association, with its 90,000 members, includes station-masters,
inspectors, and other supervisory grades. Bank officers, insurance
officials, pottery managers, technical engineers, not to mention clerks
and foremen, are organized in their respective associations. A
considerable number of organizations of brain-workers are united in the
National Federation of Professional Workers.</p>
<p>To complete the transformation all that is needed is that this new
class of officials, who fifty years ago were almost unknown, should
recognize that they, like the manual workers, are the victims of the
domination of property, and that both professional pride and economic
interest require that they should throw in their lot with the rest of
those who are engaged in constructive work. Their position to-day is
often, indeed, very far from being a happy one. Many of them, like some
mine managers, are miserably paid. Their tenure of their posts is
sometimes highly insecure. Their opportunities for promotion may be few,
and distributed with a singular capriciousness. They see the prizes of
industry awarded by favouritism, or by the nepotism which results in the
head of a business unloading upon it a family of sons whom it would be
economical to pay to keep out of it, and which, indignantly denounced on
the rare occasions on which it occurs in the public service, is so much
the rule in private industry that no one even questions its propriety.
During the war they have found that, while the organized workers have
secured advances, their own salaries have often remained almost
stationary, because they have been too genteel to take part in trade
unionism, and that today they are sometimes paid less than the men for
whose work they are supposed to be responsible. Regarded by the workmen
as the hangers-on of the masters, and by their employers as one section
among the rest of the “hands,” they have the odium of capitalism without
its power or its profits.</p>
<p>From the conversion of industry into a profession those who at
present do its intellectual work have as much to gain as the manual
workers. For the principle of function, for which we have pleaded as the
basis of industrial organization, supplies the only intelligible
standard by which the powers and duties of the different groups engaged
in industry can be determined. At the present time no such standard
exists. The social order of the pre-industrial era, of which faint
traces have survived in the forms of academic organization, was marked
by a careful grading of the successive stages in the progress from
apprentice to master, each of which was distinguished by clearly defined
rights and duties, varying from grade to grade and together forming a
hierarchy of functions. The industrial system which developed in the
course of the nineteenth century did not admit any principle of
organization other than the convenience of the individual, who by
enterprise, skill, good fortune, unscrupulous energy or mere nepotism,
happened at any moment to be in a position to wield economic authority.
His powers were what he could exercise; his rights were what at any time
he could assert. The Lancashire mill-owner of the fifties was, like the
Cyclops, a law unto himself. Hence, since subordination and discipline
are indispensable in any complex undertaking, the subordination which
emerged in industry was that of servant to master, and the discipline
such as economic strength could impose upon economic weakness.</p>
<p>The alternative to the allocation of power by the struggle of
individuals for self-aggrandizement is its allocation according to
function, that each group in the complex process of production should
wield so much authority as, and no more authority than, is needed to
enable it to perform the special duties for which it is responsible. An
organization of industry based on this principle does not imply the
merging of specialized economic functions in an undifferentiated
industrial democracy, or the obliteration of the brain workers beneath
the sheer mass of artisans and labourers. But it is incompatible with
the unlimited exercise of economic power by any class or individual. It
would have as its fundamental rule that the only powers which a man can
exercise are those conferred upon him in virtue of his office.</p>
<p>There would be subordination. But it would be profoundly different
from that which exists to-day. For it would not be the subordination of
one man to another, but of all men to the purpose for which industry is
carried on. There would be authority. But it would not be the authority
of the individual who imposes rules in virtue of his economic power for
the attainment of his economic advantage. It would be the authority
springing from the necessity of combining different duties to attain a
common end. There would be discipline. But it would be the discipline
involved in pursuing that end, not the discipline enforced upon one man
for the convenience or profit of another.</p>
<p>Under such an organization of industry the brain worker might expect,
as never before, to come to his own. He would be estimated and promoted
by his capacity, not by his means. He would be less likely than at
present to find doors closed to him because of poverty. His judges would
be his colleagues, not an owner of property intent on dividends. He
would not suffer from the perversion of values which rates the talent
and energy by which wealth is created lower than the possession of
property, which is at best their pensioner and at worst the spend-thrift
of what intelligence has produced. In a society organized for the
encouragement of creative activity those who are esteemed most highly
will be those who create, as in a world organized for enjoyment they are
those who own.</p>
</section>
<section id="b-the-position-of-the-mine-manager-under-nationalisation" class="level2">
<h2>(b) The Position of the Mine-Manager under Nationalisation</h2>
<p>Such considerations are too general and abstract to carry conviction.
Greater concreteness may be given them by comparing the present position
of mine-managers with that which they would occupy were effect given to
Mr. Justice Sankey’s scheme for the nationalization of the Coal
Industry. A body of technicians who are weighing the probable effects of
such a reorganization will naturally consider them in relation both to
their own professional prospects and to the efficiency of the service of
which they are the working heads. They will properly take into account
questions of salaries, pensions, security of status and promotion. At
the same time they will wish to be satisfied as to points which, though
not less important, are less easily defined. Under which system, private
or public ownership, will they have most personal discretion and
authority over the conduct of matters within their professional
competence? Under which will they have the best guarantee that their
special knowledge will carry due weight, and that, when handling matters
of art, they will not be overridden or obstructed by amateurs?</p>
<p>As far as the specific case of the Coal Industry is concerned, the
question of security and salaries need hardly be discussed. The greatest
admirer of the present system would not argue that security of status is
among the advantages which it offers to its employees. It is notorious
that, in some districts at least, managers are liable to be dismissed,
however professionally competent they may be, if they express in public
views which are not approved by the directors of their company. Indeed,
the criticism which is normally made on the public services, and made
not wholly without reason, is that the security which they offer is
excessive. On the question of salaries rather more than one-half of the
colliery companies of Great Britain themselves supplied figures to the
Coal Industry Commission. If their returns may be trusted, it would
appear that mine-managers, as a class, are paid salaries the parsimony
of which is the more surprising in view of the emphasis laid, and quite
properly laid, by the mine-owners on the managers’ responsibilities. The
service of the State does not normally offer, and ought not to offer,
financial prizes comparable with those of private industry. But it is
improbable, had the mines been its property during the last ten years,
that more than one-half the managers would have been in receipt of
salaries of less than £401 per year in 1913, and of less than £500 in
1919, by which time prices had more than doubled, and the aggregate
profits of the mine-owners (of which the greater part was, however,
taken by the State in taxation) had amounted in five years to
£160,000,000.</p>
<p>It would be misleading to suggest that the salaries paid to
mine-managers are typical of private industry, nor need it be denied
that the probable effect of turning an industry into a public service
would be to reduce the size of the largest prizes at present offered.
What is to be expected is that the lower and medium salaries would be
raised, and the largest somewhat diminished. It is hardly to be denied,
at any rate, that the majority of brain workers in industry have nothing
to fear on financial grounds from such a change as is proposed by
Mr. Justice Sankey. Under the normal organization of industry, profits,
it cannot be too often insisted, do not go to them but to shareholders.
There does not appear to be any reason to suppose that the salaries of
managers in the mines making more than 5/- profit a ton were any larger
than in those making under 3/-.</p>
<p>The financial aspect of the change is not, however, the only point
which a group of managers or technicians have to consider. They have
also to weigh its effect on their professional status. Will they have as
much freedom, initiative and authority in the service of the community
as under private ownership? How that question is answered depends upon
the form given to the administrative system through which a public
service is conducted. It is possible to conceive an arrangement under
which the life of a mine-manager would be made a burden to him by
perpetual recalcitrance on the part of the men at the pit for which he
is responsible. It is possible to conceive one under which he would be
hampered to the point of paralysis by irritating interference from a
bureaucracy at headquarters. In the past some managers of “cooperative
workshops” suffered, it would seem, from the former: many officers of
Employment Exchanges are the victims, unless common rumour is
misleading, of the latter. It is quite legitimate, indeed it is
indispensable, that these dangers should be emphasized. The problem of
reorganizing industry is, as has been said above, a problem of
constitution making. It will be handled successfully only if the defects
to which different types of constitutional machinery are likely to be
liable are pointed out in advance.</p>
<p>Once, however, these dangers are realized, to devise precautions
against them appears to be a comparatively simple matter. If Mr. Justice
Sankey’s proposals be taken as a concrete example of the position which
would be occupied by the managers in a nationalized industry, it will be
seen that they do not involve either of the two dangers which are
pointed out above. The manager will, it is true, work with a Local
Mining Council or pit committee, which is to “meet fortnightly, or
oftener if need be, to advise the manager on all questions concerning
the direction and safety of the mine,” and “if the manager refuses to
take the advice of the Local Mining Council on any question concerning
the safety and health of the mine, such question shall be referred to
the District Mining Council.” It is true also that, once such a Local
Mining Council is formally established, the manager will find it
necessary to win its confidence, to lead by persuasion, not by mere
driving, to establish, in short, the same relationships of comradeship
and goodwill as ought to exist between the colleagues in any common
undertaking. But in all this there is nothing to undermine his
authority, unless “authority” be understood to mean an arbitrary power
which no man is fit to exercise, and which few men, in their sober
moments, would claim. The manager will be appointed by, and responsible
to, not the men whose work he supervises, but the District Mining
Council, which controls all the pits in a district, and on that council
he will be represented.</p>
<p>Nor will he be at the mercy of a distant “clerkocracy,” overwhelming
him with circulars and overriding his expert knowledge with
impracticable mandates devised in London. The very kernel of the schemes
advanced both by Mr. Justice Sankey and by the Miners’ Federation is
decentralized administration within the framework of a national system.
There is no question of “managing the industry from Whitehall.” The
characteristics of different coal-fields vary so widely that reliance on
local knowledge and experience are essential, and it is to local
knowledge and experience that it is proposed to entrust the
administration of the industry. The constitution which is recommended
is, in short, not “Unitary” but “Federal.” There will be a division of
functions and powers between central authorities and district
authorities. The former will lay down general rules as to those matters
which must necessarily be dealt with on a national basis. The latter
will administer the industry within their own districts, and, as long as
they comply with those rules and provide their quota of coal, will
possess local autonomy and will follow the method of working the pits
which they think best suited to local conditions.</p>
<p>Thus interpreted, public ownership does not appear to confront the
brain worker with the danger of unintelligent interference with his
special technique, of which he is, quite naturally, apprehensive. It
offers him, indeed, far larger opportunities of professional development
than are open to all but a favoured few to-day, when considerations of
productive efficiency, which it is his special <em>métier</em> to
promote, are liable to be overridden by short-sighted financial
interests operating through the pressure of a Board of Directors who
desire to show an immediate profit to their shareholders, and who, to
obtain it, will “cream” the pit, or work it in a way other than
considerations of technical efficiency would dictate. And the interest
of the community in securing that the manager’s professional skill is
liberated for the service of the public, is as great as his own. For the
economic developments of the last thirty years have made the managerial
and technical <em>personnel</em> of industry the repositories of public
responsibilities of quite incalculable importance, which, with the best
will in the world, they can hardly at present discharge.</p>
<p>The most salient characteristic of modern industrial organization is
that production is carried on under the general direction of business
men, who do not themselves necessarily know anything of productive
processes. “Business” and “industry” tend to an increasing extent to
form two compartments, which, though united within the same economic
system, employ different types of <em>personnel</em>, evoke different
qualities and recognize different standards of efficiency and
workmanship. The technical and managerial staff of industry is, of
course, as amenable as other men to economic incentives. But their
special work is production, not finance; and, provided they are not
smarting under a sense of economic injustice, they want, like most
workmen, to “see the job done properly.” The business men who ultimately
control industry are concerned with the promotion and capitalization of
companies, with competitive selling and the advertisement of wares, the
control of markets, the securing of special advantages, and the
arrangement of pools, combines and monopolies. They are pre-occupied, in
fact, with financial results, and are interested in the actual making of
goods only in so far as financial results accrue from it.</p>
</section>
<section id="c-the-increasing-separation-of-business-and-industry" class="level2">
<h2>(c) The Increasing Separation of “Business” and Industry</h2>
<p>The change in organization which has, to a considerable degree,
specialized the spheres of business and management is comparable in its
importance to that which separated business and labour a century and a
half ago. It is specially momentous for the consumer. As long as the
functions of manager, technician and capitalist were combined, as in the
classical era of the factory system, in the single person of “the
employer,” it was not unreasonable to assume that profits and productive
efficiency ran similarly together. In such circumstances the ingenuity
with which economists proved that, in obedience to “the law of
substitution,” he would choose the most economical process, machine, or
type of organization, wore a certain plausibility. True, the employer
might, even so, adulterate his goods or exploit the labour of a helpless
class of workers. But as long as the person directing industry was
himself primarily a manager, he could hardly have the training, ability
or time, even if he had the inclination, to concentrate special
attention on financial gains unconnected with, or opposed to, progress
in the arts of production, and there was some justification for the
conventional picture which represented “the manufacturer” as the
guardian of the interests of the consumer.</p>
<p>With the drawing apart of the financial and technical departments of
industry—with the separation of “business” from “production”—the link
which bound profits to productive efficiency is tending to be snapped.
There are more ways than formerly of securing the former without
achieving the latter; and, when it is pleaded that the interests of the
captain of industry stimulate the adoption of the most “economical”
methods, and thus secure industrial progress, it is necessary to ask
“economical for whom?” Though the organization of industry which is most
efficient, in the sense of offering the consumer the best service at
the, lowest real cost, may be that which is most profitable to the firm,
it is also true that profits are constantly made in ways which have
nothing to do with efficient production, and which sometimes, indeed,
impede it.</p>
<p>The manner in which “business” may find that the methods which pay
itself best are those which a truly “scientific management” would
condemn may be illustrated by three examples. In the first place, the
whole mass of profits which are obtained by the adroit capitalization of
a new business, or the reconstruction of one which already exists, have
hardly any connection with production at all. When, for instance, a
Lancashire cotton mill capitalized at £100,000 is bought by a London
syndicate which re-floats it with a capital of £500,000—not at all an
extravagant case—what exactly has happened? In many cases the equipment
of the mill for production remains, after the process, what it was
before it. It is, however, valued at a different figure, because it is
anticipated that the product of the mill will sell at a price which will
pay a reasonable profit not only upon the lower, but upon the higher,
capitalization. If the apparent state of the market and prospects of the
industry are such that the public can be induced to believe this, the
promoters of the reconstruction find it worth while to recapitalize the
mill on the new basis. They make their profit not as manufacturers, but
as financiers. They do not in any way add to the productive efficiency
of the firm, but they acquire shares which will entitle them to an
increased return. Normally, if the market is favourable, they part with
the greater number of them as soon as they are acquired. But, whether
they do so or not, what has occurred is a process by which the business
element in industry obtains the right to a larger share of the product,
without in any way increasing the efficiency of the service which is
offered to the consumer.</p>
<p>Other examples of the manner in which the control of production by
“business” cuts across the line of economic progress are the wastes of
competitive industry and the profits of monopoly. It is obvious that the
price paid by the consumer includes marketing costs, which to a varying,
but to a large, extent are expenses not of supplying the goods, but of
supplying them under conditions involving the expenses of advertisement
and competitive distribution. For the individual firm such expenses,
which enable it to absorb part of a rival’s trade, may be an economy: to
the consumer of milk or coal—to take two flagrant instances—they are
pure loss. Nor, as is sometimes assumed, are such wastes confined to
distribution. Technical reasons are stated by railway managers to make
desirable a unification of railway administration and by mining experts
of mines. But, up to the war, business considerations maintained the
expensive system under which each railway company was operated as a
separate system, and still prevent collieries, even collieries in the
same district, from being administered as parts of a single
organization. Pits are drowned out by water, because companies cannot
agree to apportion between them the costs of a common drainage system;
materials are bought, and products sold, separately, because collieries
will not combine; small coal is left in to the amount of millions of
tons because the most economical and technically efficient working of
the seams is not necessarily that which yields the largest profit to the
business men who control production.</p>
<p>In this instance the wide differences in economic strength which
exist between different mines discourage the unification which is
economically desirable; naturally the directors of a company which owns
“a good thing” do not desire to merge interests with a company working
coal that is poor in quality or expensive to mine. When, as increasingly
happens in other industries, competitive wastes, or some of them, are
eliminated by combination, there is a genuine advance in technical
efficiency, which must be set to the credit of business motives. In that
event, however, the divergence between business interests and those of
the consumers is merely pushed, one stage further forward. It arises, of
course, over the question of prices.</p>
<p>If any one is disposed to think that this picture of the economic
waste which accompanies the domination of production by business
interests is overdrawn, he may be invited to consider the criticism upon
the system passed by the “efficiency engineers,” who are increasingly
being called upon to advise as to industrial organization and equipment,
and who, so far from being tainted with Socialism, have been nurtured on
the purest milk of the Capitalist creed. “The higher officers of the
corporation,” writes Mr. H. L. Gantt, of a Public Utility Company
established in America during the war, “have all without exception been
men of the ‘business’ type of mind, who have made their success through
financiering, buying, selling, etc…. As a matter of fact it is well
known that our industrial system has not measured up as we had expected…
<em>The reason for its falling short is undoubtedly that the men
directing it had been trained in a business system operated for profits,
and did not understand one operated solely for production.</em> This is
no criticism of the men as individuals; they simply did not know the
job, and, what is worse, they did not know that they did not know
it.”</p>
<p>In so far, then, as “Business” and “Management” are separated, the
latter being employed under the direction of the former, it cannot be
assumed that the direction of industry is in the hands of persons whose
primary concern is productive efficiency. That a considerable degree of
efficiency will result incidentally from the pursuit of business profits
is not, of course, denied. What seems to be true, however, is that the
main interest of those directing an industry which has reached this
stage of development is given to financial strategy and the control of
markets, because the gains which these activities offer are normally so
much larger than those accruing from the mere improvement of the
processes of production. It is evident, however, that it is precisely
that improvement which is the main interest of the consumer. He may
tolerate large profits as long as they are thought to be the symbol of
efficient production. But what he is concerned with is the supply of
goods, not the value of shares, and when profits appear to be made, not
by efficient production, but by skilful financiering or shrewd
commercial tactics, they no longer appear meritorious.</p>
<p>If, in disgust at what he has learned to call “profiteering,” the
consumer seeks an alternative to a system under which production is
controlled by “business,” he can hardly find it except by making an ally
of the managerial and technical <em>personnel</em> of industry. They
organize the service which he requires; they are relatively little
implicated, either by material interest or by psychological bias, in the
financial methods which he distrusts; they often find the control of
their professions by business men, who are primarily financiers,
irritating in the obstruction which it offers to technical efficiency,
as well as sharp and close-fisted in its treatment of salaries. Both on
public and professional grounds they belong to a group which ought to
take the initiative in promoting a partnership between the producers and
the public. They can offer the community the scientific knowledge and
specialized ability which is the most important condition of progress in
the arts of production. It can offer them a more secure and dignified
status, larger opportunities for the exercise of their special talents,
and the consciousness that they are giving the best of their work and
their lives, not to enriching a handful of uninspiring, if innocuous,
shareholders, but to the service of the great body of their
fellow-countrymen. If the last advantage be dismissed as a phrase—if
medical officers of health, directors of education, and directors of the
Co-operative Wholesale be assumed to be quite uninfluenced by any
consciousness of social service—the first two, at any rate, remain. And
they are considerable.</p>
<p>It is this gradual disengagement of managerial technique from
financial interests which would appear to be the probable line along
which “the employer” of the future will develop. The substitution
throughout industry of fixed salaries for fluctuating profits would, in
itself, deprive his position of half the humiliating atmosphere of
predatory enterprise which embarrasses to-day any man of honour who
finds himself, when he has been paid for his services in possession of a
surplus for which there is no assignable reason. Nor, once large incomes
from profits have been extinguished, need his salary be large, as
incomes are reckoned to-day. It is said that among the barbarians, where
wealth is still measured by cattle, great chiefs are described as
hundred-cow men. The manager of a great enterprise, who is paid £10,000
a year, might similarly be described as a hundred-family man, since he
receives the income of a hundred families. It is true that special
talent is worth any price, and that a payment of £10,000 a year to the
head of a business with a turnover of millions is economically a
bagatelle. But economic considerations are not the only considerations.
There is also “the point of honour.” And the truth is that these
hundred-family salaries are ungentlemanly.</p>
<p>When really important issues are at stake every one realizes that no
decent man can stand out for his price. A general does not haggle with
his government for the precise pecuniary equivalent of his contribution
to victory. A sentry who gives the alarm to a sleeping battalion does
not spend next day collecting the capital value of the lives he has
saved; he is paid i/a day and is lucky if he gets it. The commander of a
ship does not cram himself and his belongings into the boats and leave
the crew to scramble out of the wreck as best they can; by the tradition
of the service he is the last man to leave.</p>
<p>“I want,” Lord Haldane told the Coal Commission, “to make the service
of the State in civilian things as proud a position as it is with the
Army and Navy to-day, and for there to be public spirit, public honour,
and public recognition. Just as you get the engineer officer who will
throw a bridge over a river with extraordinary skill, although he seems
to have no materials with which to do it, so you may develop the same
kind of capacity in that officer when he deals with a civilian problem.”
There is no reason why the public should insult manufacturers and men of
business by treating them as though they were more thick-skinned than
generals and more extravagant than privates. To say that they are worth
a good deal more than even the exorbitant salaries which some of them
get is often true. But it is beside the point. No one has any business
to expect to be paid “what he is worth,” for what he is worth is a
matter between his own soul and God. What he has a right to demand, and
what it concerns his fellow-men to see that he gets, is enough to enable
him to perform his work. When industry is organized on a basis of
function, that, and no more than that, is what he will be paid. To do
the managers of industry justice, this whining for more money is a vice
to which they (as distinct from their shareholders) are not particularly
prone. There is no reason why they should be. If a man has important
work, and enough leisure and income to enable him to do it properly, he
is in possession of as much happiness as is good for any of the children
of Adam.</p>

<h1>Porro Unum Necessarium</h1>
<p>So the organization of society on the basis of functions, instead of
on that of rights, implies three things. It means, first, that
proprietary rights shall be maintained when they are accompanied by the
performance of service and abolished when they are not. It means,
second, that the producers shall stand in a direct relation to the
community for whom production is carried on, so that their
responsibility to it may be obvious and unmistakable, not lost, as at
present, through their immediate subordination to shareholders whose
interest is not service but gain. It means, in the third place, that the
obligation for the maintenance of the service shall rest upon the
professional organizations of those who perform it, and that, subject to
the supervision and criticism of the consumer, those organizations shall
exercise so much voice in the government of industry as may be needed to
secure that the obligation is discharged.</p>
<p>It is obvious, indeed, that no change of system or machinery can
avert those causes of social <em>malaise</em> which consist in the
egotism, greed, or quarrelsomeness of human nature. What it can do is to
create an environment in which those are not the qualities which are
encouraged. It cannot secure that men live up to their principles. What
it can do is to establish their social order upon principles to which,
if they please, they can live up and not live down. It cannot control
their actions. It can offer them an end on which to fix their minds.
And, as their minds are, so, in the long run and with J exceptions,
their practical activity will be.</p>
<p>The first condition of the right organization of industry is, then,
the intellectual conversion which, in their distrust of principles.
Englishmen are disposed to place last or to omit altogether. It is that
emphasis should be transferred from the opportunities which it offers
individuals to the social functions which it performs; that they should
be clear as to its end and should judge it by reference to that end, not
by incidental consequences which are foreign to it, however brilliant or
alluring those consequences may be. What gives its meaning to any
activity which is not purely automatic is its purpose. It is because the
purpose of industry, which is the conquest of nature for the service of
man, is neither adequately expressed in its organization nor present to
the minds of those engaged in it, because it is not regarded as a
function but as an opportunity for personal gain or advancement or
display, that the economic life of modern societies is in a perpetual
state of morbid irritation. If the conditions which produce that
unnatural tension are to be removed, it can only be effected by the
growth of a habit of mind which will approach, questions of economic
organization from the stand! point of the purpose which it exists to
serve, and which will apply to it something of the spirit expressed by
Bacon when he said that the work of men ought to be carried on “for the
glory of God and the relief of men’s estate.”</p>
<p>Sentimental idealism? But consider the alternative. The alternative
is war; and continuous war must, sooner or later, mean something like
the destruction of civilization. The havoc which the assertion of the
right to unlimited economic expansion has made of the world of States
needs no emphasis. Those who have lived from 1914 to 1921 will not ask
why mankind has not progressed more swiftly; they will be inclined to
wonder that it has progressed at all. For every century or oftener it
has torn itself to pieces, usually, since 1648, because it supposed
prosperity was to be achieved by the destruction of an economic rival;
and, as these words are written, the victors in the war for freedom, in
defiance of their engagements and amid general applause from the classes
who will suffer most from the heroics of their rulers, are continuing
the process of ruining themselves in order to enjoy the satisfaction of
more completely ruining the vanquished. The test of the objects of a war
is the peace which follows it. Millions of human beings endured for four
years the extremes of misery for ends which they believed to be but
little tainted with the meaner kinds of self-interest. But the historian
of the future will consider, not what they thought, but what their
statesmen did. He will read the Treaty of Versailles; and he will be
merciful if, in its provisions with regard to coal and shipping and
enemy property and colonies and indemnities, he does not find written
large the <em>Macht-Politik</em> of the Acquisitive Society, the
natural, if undesired, consequence of which is war.</p>
<p>There are, however, various degrees both of war and of peace, and it
is an illusion to suppose that domestic tranquillity is either the
necessary, or the probable, alternative, to military collisions abroad.
What is more probable, unless mankind succeeds in basing its social
organisation upon some moral principles which command general
acceptance, is an embittered struggle of classes, interests, and groups.
The principle upon which our society professed to be based for nearly a
hundred years after 1789—the principle of free competition—has clearly
spent its force. In the last few years Great Britain—not to mention
America and Germany—has plunged, as far as certain great industries are
concerned, into an era of something like monopoly with the same
light-hearted recklessness as a century ago it flung itself into an era
of individualism. No one who reads the Reports of the Committee on
Trusts appointed by the Ministry of Reconstruction and of the Committees
set up under the Profiteering Act upon soap, or sewing cotton, or oil,
or half-a-dozen other products, can retain the illusion that the
consumer is protected by the rivalry of competing producers. The choice
before him, to an increasing extent, is not between competition and
monopoly, but between a monopoly which is irresponsible and private and
a monopoly which is responsible and public. No one who observes how
industrial agreements between workers and employers are actually reached
can fail to see that they are settled by a trial of strength between two
compactly organized armies, who are restrained from collision only by
fear of its possible consequences. Fear is a powerful, but a capricious,
motive, and it will not always restrain them. When prudence is overborne
by rashness, or when the hope of gain outweighs the apprehension of
loss, there will be a collision. No man can say where it will end. No
man can even say with confidence that it will produce a more tolerable
social order. It is idle to urge that any alternative is preferable to
government by the greedy materialists who rule mankind at present, for
greed and materialism are not the monopoly of a class. If those who have
the will to make a better society have not at present the power, it is
conceivable that, when they have the power, they too, like their
predecessors, may not have the will.</p>
<p>So, in the long run, it is the principles which men accept as the
basis of their social organization I which matter. And the principle
which we have tried to put forward is that industry and property and
economic activity should be treated as functions, and should be tested,
at every point, by their relation to a social purpose. Viewed from that
angle, issues which are insoluble when treated on the basis of rights
may be found more susceptible of reasonable treatment. For a purpose is,
in the first place a principle of limitation. It determines the end for
which, and therefore the limits within which, an activity is to be
carried on. It divides what is worth doing from what is not, and settles
the scale upon which what is worth doing ought to be done. It is, in the
second place, a principle of unity, because it supplies a common end to
which efforts can be directed, and submits interests, which would
otherwise conflict, to the judgment of an over-ruling object. It is, in
the third place, a principle of apportionment or distribution. It
assigns to the different parties of groups engaged in a common
undertaking the place which they are to occupy in carrying it out. Thus
it establishes order, not upon chance or power, but upon a principle,
and bases remuneration not upon what men can with good fortune snatch
for themselves, nor upon what, if unlucky, they can be induced to
accept, but upon what is appropriate to their function, no more and no
less, so that those who perform no function receive no payment, and
those who contribute to the common end receive honourable payment for
honourable service.</p>
<p>Such a political philosophy implies that society is not an economic
mechanism, but a community of wills which are often discordant, but
which are capable of being inspired by devotion to common ends. It is,
therefore, a religious one, and, if it is true, the proper bodies to
propagate it are the Christian Churches. During the last two centuries
Europe, and particularly industrial Europe, has seen the development of
a society in which what is called personal religion continues to be
taught as the rule of individual conduct, but in which the very
conception of religion as the inspiration and standard of social life
and corporate effort has been forgotten. The phenomenon is a curious
one. To suggest that an individual is not a Christian may be libellous.
To preach in public that Christianity is absurd is legally blasphemy. To
state that the social ethics of the New Testament are obligatory upon
men in the business affairs which occupy nine-tenths of their thought,
or on the industrial organization which gives our society its character,
is to preach revolution. To suggest that they apply to the relations of
States may be held to be sedition. Such a creed does not find it
difficult to obey the injunction: “Render unto Caesar the things that
are Caesar’s and unto God the things that are God’s.” To their first
hearers the words must have come with a note of gentle irony, for to the
reader of the New Testament the things which are Caesar’s appear to be
singularly few. The modern world is not seriously inconvenienced by
rendering to God the things which are God’s. They are not numerous, nor
are they of the kind which it misses.</p>
<p>The phenomenon is not the less singular because its historical
explanation is comparatively easy. When the Church of England was turned
into the moral police of the State, it lost the independence which might
have enabled it to maintain the peculiar and distinctive Christian
standard of social conduct—a standard which must always appear
paradoxical and extravagant to the mass of mankind and especially to the
powerful and rich, and which only an effort of mind and will perpetually
renewed, perpetually sustained and emphasized by the support of a
corporate society, can preserve in the face of their natural scepticism.
Deprived of its own vitality, it had allowed its officers to become by
the eighteenth century the servile clients of a half-pagan aristocracy,
to whose contemptuous indulgence they looked for preferment. It ceased
for some 200 years to speak its mind, and, as a natural consequence, it
ceased to have a mind to speak. As an organization for common worship it
survived. As an organ of collective thought and of a common will it
became negligible.</p>
<p>Had the Nonconformist societies, taken up the testimony which the
Church of England had dropped, the Christian tradition of social ethics
might have continued to find an organ of expression. Among individual
Puritans, as the teaching of Baxter, or the life of Woolman, shows, it
did, indeed, survive. But the very circumstances of their origin
disposed the Nonconformist Churches to lay only a light emphasis on the
social aspects of Christianity. They had grown up as the revolt of the
spirit against an overgrown formalism, an artificial and insincere
unity. They drew their support largely from the earnest and sober piety
of the trading and commercial classes. Individualist in their faith,
they were individualist in their interpretation of social morality.
Insisting that the essence of religion was the contact of the individual
soul with its Maker, they regarded the social order and its
consequences, not as the instrument through which grace is mediated, or
as steps in the painful progress by which the soul climbs to a fuller
vision, but as something external, alien, and irrelevant—something, at
best, indifferent to personal salvation, and, at worst, the sphere of
the letter which killeth and of the reliance on works which ensnares the
spirit into the slumber of death.</p>
<p>In a society thus long obtuse to one whole aspect of the Christian
Faith, it was natural that the restraints imposed on social conduct by
mere tradition, personal kindliness, the inertia of use and wont should
snap like green withies before the intoxicating revelation of riches
which burst on the early nineteenth century. It was the more natural
because the creed which rushed into the vacuum was itself a kind of
religion, a persuasive, self-confident and militant Gospel proclaiming
the absolute value of economic success. The personal piety of the
Nonconformist could stem that creed as little as the stiff conservatism
of the Churchman. Indeed, with a few individual exceptions, they did not
try to stem it, for they had lost the spiritual independence needed to
appraise its true moral significance. So they accepted without misgiving
the sharp separation of the sphere of Christianity from that of economic
expediency, which was its main assumption, and affirmed that religion
was a thing of the spirit, which was degraded if it were
externalised.</p>
<p>“In the days when Oliver, master of the Schools at Cologne, preached
the Crusade against the Saracens,” a certain rich miller, who was also a
usurer, heard, as he lay in bed, an unwonted rumbling in his mill. He
opened the door, and saw two coal-black horses, and by their side an
ill-favoured man as black as they. It was the devil. The fiend forced
him to mount, and rode with him to hell, where, amid the torments of
others who had been unscrupulous in the pursuit of gain, he saw “a
burning fiery chair, wherein could be no rest, but torture and
interminable pain,” and was told, “Now shalt thou return to thy house,
and thou shalt have thy reward in this chair.” The miller died
unconfessed, and the priest who, in return for a bribe, buried him in
consecrated ground, was suspended from his office.</p>
<p>The fancies of an age which saw in economic motives the most
insidious temptation to the disregard of moral principles may serve to
emphasise, by the extravagance of the contrast, the perils of one in
which the economic motive is regarded as needing no higher credential.
The idea that conduct which is commercially successful may be morally
wicked is as unfamiliar to the modern world as the idea that a type of
social organization which is economically efficient may be inconsistent
with principles of right. A dock company which employs several thousand
casual labourers for three days a week, or an employers’ association,
which uses its powerful organization to oppose an extension of
education, in order that its members may continue to secure cheap child
labour, or a trade union which sacrifices the public to its own
professional interests, or a retail firm which pays wages that are an
incentive to prostitution, may be regarded as incompetent in its
organization or as deficient in the finer shades of public spirit. But
neither they, nor the community which may profit by their conduct, are
regarded as guilty of sin, even by those whom professional exigencies
have compelled to retain that unfashionable word in their
vocabulary.</p>
<p>The abdication by the Christian Churches of one whole department of
life, that of social and political conduct, as the sphere of the powers
of this world and of them alone, is one of the capital revolutions
through which the human spirit has passed. The mediaeval church, with
all its extravagances and abuses, had asserted the whole compass of
human interests to be the province of religion. The disposition to
idealise it in the interests of some contemporary ecclesiastical or
social propaganda is properly regarded with suspicion. But, though the
practice of its officers was often odious, it cannot be denied that the
essence of its moral teaching had been the attempts to uphold a rule of
right, by which all aspects of human conduct were to be judged, and
which was not merely to be preached as an ideal, but to be enforced as a
practical obligation upon members of the Christian community. It had
claimed, however grossly the claim might be degraded by political
intrigues and ambitions, to judge the actions of rulers by a standard
superior to political expediency. It had tried to impart some moral
significance to the ferocity of the warrior by enlisting him in the
service of God. It had even sought, with a self-confidence which was
noble, if perhaps over-sanguine, to bring the contracts of business and
the transactions of economic life within the scope of a body of
Christian casuistry.</p>
<p>The Churches of the nineteenth century had no strong assurance of the
reality of any spiritual order invisible to the eye of sense, which was
to be upheld, however much it might be derided, however violent the
contrast which it offered to the social order created by men.
Individuals among their officers and members spoke and acted as men who
had; but they were rarely followed, and sometimes repudiated. Possessing
no absolute standards of their own, the Churches were at the mercy of
those who did possess them. They relieved the wounded, and comforted the
dying, but they dared not enter the battle. For men will fight only for
a cause in which they believe, and what the Churches lacked was not
personal virtue, or public spirit, or practical wisdom, but something
more simple and more indispensable, something which the Children of
Light are supposed to impart to the children of this world, but which
they could not impart, because they did not possess it—faith in their
own creed and in their vocation to make it prevail. So they made
religion the ornament of leisure, instead of the banner of a Crusade.
They became the home of “a fugitive and cloistered virtue, unexercised
and unbreathed, that never sallies out and seeks her adversary, but
slinks out of the race, where that immortal garland is to be run for,
not without dust and heat.” They acquiesced in the popular assumption
that the acquisition of riches was the main end of man, and confined
themselves to preaching such personal virtues as did not conflict with
its achievement.</p>
<p>The world has now sufficient experience to judge the truth of the
doctrine—the Gospel according to the Churches of Laodicea—which affirms
that the power of religion in the individual soul is nicely proportioned
to its powerlessness in society. Whether the life of the spirit is made
easier for the individual by surrendering his social environment to a
ruthless economic egotism is a question which each man must answer for
himself. In the sphere of social morality the effect of that philosophy
is not dubious. The rejection of the social ethics of Christianity was
only gradually felt, because they were the school in which individuals
continued to be educated long after other standards had taken their
place as the criterion for judging institutions, policy, the conduct of
business, the organization of industry and public affairs. Its fruits,
though they matured slowly, are now being gathered. In our own day the
horrors which sixty years ago were thought to be exorcised by the
advance of civilization have one by one rolled back, the rule of the
sword and of the assassin hired by governments, as in Ireland, a
hardly-veiled slavery, as in East Africa, a contempt for international
law by the great Powers which would have filled an earlier generation
with amazement, and in England the prostitution of humanity and personal
honour and the decencies of public life to the pursuit of money.</p>
<p>These things have occurred before, in ages which were nominally
Christian. What is distinctive of our own is less its occasional
relapses or aberrations, than its assumption that the habitual conduct
and organization of society is a matter to which religion is merely
irrelevant. That attempt to conduct human affairs in the light of no end
other than the temporary appetites of individuals has as its natural
consequences oppression, the unreasoning and morbid pursuit of pecuniary
gain of which the proper name is the sin of avarice, and civil war. In
so far as Christianity is taken seriously, it destroys alike the
arbitrary power of the few and the slavery of many, since it maintains a
standard by which both are condemned—a standard which men did not create
and which is independent of their convenience or desires. By affirming
that all men are the children of God, it insists that the rights of all
men are equal. By affirming that men are men and nothing more, it is a
warning that those rights are conditional and derivative—a commission of
service, not a property. To such a faith nothing is common or unclean,
and in a Christian society social institutions, economic activity,
industrial organization cease to be either indifferent or merely means
for the satisfaction of human appetites. They arc judged, not merely by
their convenience, but by standards of right and wrong. They become
stages in the progress of mankind to perfection, and derive a certain
sacramental significance from the spiritual end to which, if only as a
kind of squalid scaffolding, they are ultimately related.</p>
<p>Hence the opinion, so frequently expressed, that the religion of a
society makes no practical difference to the conduct of its affairs is
not only contrary to experience, but of its very nature superficial. The
creed of indifferentism, detached from the social order which is the
greatest and most massive expression of the scale of values that is the
working faith of a society, may make no difference, except to damn more
completely those who profess it. But then, so tepid and self-regarding a
creed is not a religion. Christianity cannot allow its sphere to be
determined by the convenience of politicians or by the conventional
ethics of the world of business. The whole world of human interests was
assigned to it as its province. “The law of divinity is to lead the
lowest through the intermediate to the highest things.” In discharging
its commission, therefore, a Christian Church will constantly enter the
departments of politics and of economic relations, because it is only a
bad modern convention which allows men to forget that these things, as
much as personal conduct, are the sphere of the spirit and the
expression of character. It will insist that membership in it involves
obedience to a certain rule of life, and the renunciation of the prizes
offered by economic mastery.</p>
<p>A rule of life, a discipline, a standard and habit of conduct in the
social relations which make up the texture of life for the mass of
mankind—the establishment of these among its own members, and their
maintenance by the corporate conscience of the Christian society, is
among the most vital tasks of any Church which takes its religion
seriously. It is idle for it to expound the Christian Faith to those who
do not accept it, unless at the same time it is the guardian of the way
of life involved in that Faith among those who nominally do. Either a
Church is a society, or it is nothing. But, if a society is to exist, it
must possess a corporate mind and will. And if the Church, which is a
Christian Society, is to exist, its mind and will must be set upon that
type of conduct which is specifically Christian. Hence the acceptance by
its members of a rule of life is involved in the very essence of the
Church. They will normally fail, of course, to live up to it. But when
it ceases altogether to attract them, when they think it, not the truest
wisdom, but impracticable folly, when they believe that the acceptance
of Christianity is compatible with any rule of life whatsoever or with
no rule of life at all, they have ceased, in so far as their own choice
can affect the matter, to be members of the “Church militant here on
earth.” When all its members—were that conceivable—have made such a
choice, that Church has ceased to exist.</p>
<p>The demand that a Church should possess and exercise powers of moral
discipline is not, therefore, the expression of that absurd, if
innocent, pose, a romantic and undiscriminating Mediaevalism. Such
powers are a necessary element in the life of a Church, because they are
a necessary element in the life of any society whatsoever. It is
arguable that a Church ought not to exist; it is not arguable that, when
it exists, it should lack the powers which are indispensable to any
genuine vitality. It ought to be the greatest of societies, since it is
concerned with the greatest and most enduring interests of mankind. But,
if it has not the authority to discipline its own members, which is
possessed by the humblest secular association, from an athletic club to
a trade union, it is not a society at all. The recovery and exercise of
that authority is thus among the most important of the practical reforms
in its own organization at which a Church, if it does not already
possess it, can aim, since, without it, it cannot, properly speaking, be
said fully to exist.</p>
<p>If a Church reasserts and applies its moral authority, if it insists
that, while no man is compelled to belong to it, membership involves
duties as well as privileges, if it informs its members that they have
assumed obligations which preclude them from practising certain common
kinds of economic conduct and from aiming at certain types of success
which are ordinarily esteemed, two consequences are likely to follow. It
cannot, in the first place, continue to be established. It will
probably, in the second place, lose the nominal support of a
considerable number of those who regard themselves as its adherents.
Such a decline in membership will, however, be a blessing, not a
misfortune. The tradition of universal allegiance which the Church—to
speak without distinction of denominations—has inherited from an age in
which the word “Christendom” had some meaning, is a source, not of
strength, but of weakness. It is a weakness, because, in the
circumstances of the twentieth century, it is fundamentally, if
unconsciously, insincere. The position of the Church to-day is not that
of the Middle Ages. It resembles more nearly that of the Church in the
Roman Empire before the conversion of Constantine. Christians are a
sect, and a small sect, in a Pagan Society. But they can be a sincere
sect. If they are sincere, they will not abuse the Pagans, as sometimes
in the past they were inclined to do; for a good Pagan is an admirable
person. But he is not a Christian, for his hopes and fears, his
preferences and dislikes, his standards of success and failure, are
different from those of Christians. The Church will not pretend that he
is, or endeavour to make its own Faith acceptable to him by diluting the
distinctive ethical attributes of Christianity till they become
inoffensive, at the cost of becoming trivial.</p>
<p>“<em>He hath put down the mighty from their seat, and hath exalted
the humble and meek.</em>” A society which is fortunate enough to
possess so revolutionary a basis, a society whose Founder was executed
as the enemy of law and order, need not seek to soften the materialism
of principalities and powers with mild doses of piety administered in an
apologetic whisper. It will teach as one having authority, and will have
sufficient confidence in its Faith to believe that it requires neither
artificial protection nor judicious under-statement in order that such
truth as there is in it may prevail. It will appeal to mankind, not
because its standards are identical with those of the world, but because
they are profoundly different. It will win its converts, not because
membership involves no change in their manner of life, but because it
involves a change so complete as to be ineffaceable. It will expect its
adherents to face economic ruin for the sake of their principles with
the same alacrity as, till recently, it was faced every day by the
workman who sought to establish trade unionism among his fellows. It
will define, with the aid of those of its members who are engaged in
different trades and occupations, the lines of conduct and organization
which approach most nearly to being the practical application of
Christian ethics in the various branches of economic life, and, having
defined them, will censure those of its members who depart from them
without good reason. It will rebuke the open and notorious sin of the
man who oppresses his fellows for the sake of gain as freely as that of
the drunkard or adulterer. It will voice frankly the judgment of the
Christian conscience on the acts of the State, even when to do so is an
offence to nine-tenths of its fellow-citizens. Like Missionary Churches
in Africa to-day, it will have as its aim, not merely to convert the
individual, but to make a new kind, and a Christian kind, of
civilization.</p>
<p>Such a religion is likely to be highly inconvenient to all parties
and persons who desire to dwell at ease in Zion. But it will not, at any
rate, be a matter of indifference. The marks of its influence will not
be comfort, but revolt and persecution. It will bring not peace but a
sword. Yet its end is peace. It is to harmonize the discords of human
society, by relating its activities to the spiritual purpose from which
they derive their significance.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Frate, la nostra volontà quieta</p>
<p>Virtu di carità, che fa volerne</p>
<p>Sol quel ch’avemo, e d’altro non ci asseta.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>Se disiassimo esse piu superne,</p>
<p>Foran discordi gli nostri disiri</p>
<p>Dal volar di colui che qui ne cerne… Anzi e form ale ad esto beato
esse</p>
<p>Tenersi dentro alia divina voglia.</p>
<p>Per ch’una fansi nostre voglie stesse… Chiaro mi fu allor com’ ogni
dove</p>
<p>In Cielo e paradiso, e si la grazia</p>
<p>Del sommo ben d’un modo non vi piove.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The famous lines in which Piccarda explains to Dante the order of
Paradise are a description of a complex and multiform society which is
united by overmastering devotion to a common end. By that end all
stations are assigned and all activities are valued. The parts derive
their quality from their place in the system, and are so permeated by
the unity which they express that they themselves are glad to be
forgotten, as the ribs of an arch carry the eye from the floor from
which they spring to the vault in which they meet and interlace.</p>
<p>Such a combination of unity and diversity is possible only to a
society which subordinates its activities to the principle of purpose.
For what that principle offers is not merely a standard for determining
the relations of different classes and groups of producers, but a scale
of moral values. Above all, it assigns to economic activity itself its
proper place as the servant, not the master, of society. The burden of
our civilization is not merely, as many suppose, that the product of
industry is ill-distributed, or its conduct tyrannical, or its operation
interrupted by embittered disagreements. It is that industry itself has
come to hold a position of exclusive predominance among human interests,
which no single interest, and least of all the provision of the material
means of existence, is fit to occupy. Like a hypochondriac who is so
absorbed in the processes of his own digestion that he goes to his grave
before he has begun to live, industrialized communities neglect the very
objects for which it is worth while to acquire riches in their feverish
preoccupation with the means by which riches can be acquired.</p>
<p>That obsession by economic issues is as local and transitory as it is
repulsive and disturbing. To future generations it will appear as
pitiable as the obsession of the seventeenth century by religious
quarrels appears to-day; indeed, it is less rational, since the object
with which it is concerned is less important. And it is a poison which
inflames every wound and turns each trivial scratch into a malignant
ulcer. Society will not solve the particular problems of industry which
afflict it, until that poison is expelled, and it has learned to see
industry itself in the right perspective. If it is to do that, it must
rearrange its scale of values. It must regard economic interests as one
element in life, not as the whole of life. It must persuade its members
to renounce the opportunity of gains which accrue without any
corresponding service, because the struggle for them keeps the whole
community in a fever. It must so organize its industry that the
instrumental character of economic activity is emphasized by its
subordination to the social purpose for which it is carried on.</p>
