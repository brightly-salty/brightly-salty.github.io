            <main><p>One thousand eight hundred and eighty years ago a
new law was revealed to men by Jesus Christ. By His life and His death
Christ showed to men what he who wants to be His disciple, a Christian,
may do, and what not.</p>
<p>According to Christ’s teaching, the sons of the Father are free
(Matthew 17:26), for they know the truth, and the truth shall make them
free (John 8:32). Christ’s teaching was then, even as it is now,
contrary to the teaching of the world. According to the teaching of the
world, the powers govern the nations, and, to govern them, compel some
people to kill, execute, punish others, and to swear that they will in
everything do the will of the rulers. According to Christ’s teaching, a
man not only cannot kill another, but even cannot do violence to him, or
resist him with force: he can not do evil to his neighbour, nor even to
his enemy.</p>
<p>The teaching of the world and of Christ have always been and always
will be opposed to each other. Christ knew this, and said this to His
disciples, and predicted to them that He Himself would suffer and that
they, too, would be delivered to be afflicted and killed (Matthew 24:9),
and that the world would hate them, because they would not be the
servants of the world, but of the Father (John 15:19,20).</p>
<p>And everything came to pass as Jesus had predicted. The world hated
Him and tried to ruin Him. All, the Pharisees, and the Sadducees, and
the scribes, and the Herodians, rebuked Him for being an enemy to
Caesar, for prohibiting men from paying tribute to him, for disturbing
and corrupting the world. They said that He was an evildoer, that He
made Himself a king, and so was an enemy of Caesar (John 19:12).</p>
<p>Even before He was delivered up to be put to death, they, watching
Him, sent cunning men up to Him, to catch Him in some utterance, so as
to dehver Him up to the authorities and the power of the ruler. And they
asked Him:</p>
<p>Master, we know that Thou art true, and teachest the way of God in
truth, neither carest Thou for any man: for Thou regardest not the
person of men. Tell us therefore, What thinkest Thou? Is it lawful to
give tribute unto Caesar, or not? But Jesus perceived their wickedness,
and said, Why tempt ye me, ye hypocrites? Shew me the tribute money. And
they brought unto Him a penny. And He saith unto them. Whose is this
image and superscription? They say unto Him, Csesar’s. Then saith He
unto them, Eender therefore unto Csesar the things which are Csesar’s;
and unto God the things that are God’s. When they had heard these words,
they marvelled at His answer, and grew silent.</p>
<p>They had expected Him to say, either that it is lawful and necessary
to pay tribute to Csesar, and that thus He would destroy His whole
teaching about the sons being free, about a man being obliged to hve Hke
the birds of the air, not caring for the morrow, and many similar
things; or that He would say that it is not lawful to pay tribute to
Csesar, and that thus He would show Himself to be an enemy to Caesar.
But Christ said. Unto Caesar the things which are Caesar’s, and unto God
the things which are God’s. He said more than they had expected of Him.
He defined everything, dividing everything a man has into two
parts,—into the human and the divine, and said that what is man’s may be
given to man, and what is God’s cannot be given to man, but only to God;
and what both God and Csesar claim ought to be given to God.</p>
<p>With these words He told them that if a man believes in the law of
God, he can fulfil Ccesar’s law only when it is not contrary to God’s.
For the Pharisees, who did not know the truth, there still existed a law
of God which they would not have transgressed, even if Caesar’s law
demanded it of them. They would not have departed from circumcision,
from the observance of the Sabbath, from fasting and from many other
things. If Caesar had demanded of them work on a Sabbath, they would
have said: “To Caesar belong all days, but not the Sabbath.” The same is
true of circumcision and of other things.</p>
<p>Christ showed them with His answer that God’s law stood higher than
Caesar’s, and that a man can give to Caesar only what is not contrary to
God’s law.</p>
<p>Now, what is for Christ and for His disciples Caesar’s, and what
God’s?</p>
<p>One is horrified to think of the answer to this question, which one
may hear from Christians of our time! God’s, in the opinion of our
Christians, never interferes with Caesar’s, and Caesar’s is always in
agreement with God’s. The whole life is given up to the service of
Caesar, and only what does not interfere with Caesar is turned over to
God. Not so did Christ understand it.</p>
<p>For Christ the whole life is God’s business, and what is not God’s
may be given to Caesar.</p>
<p>“Unto Caesar the things which are Caesar’s, and unto God the things
which are God’s.”</p>
<p>What is Caesar’s? The coin,—what is carnal,—not yours.</p>
<p>Give, then, everything carnal to him who will take it; but your Life,
which you have received from God, is all God’s. This cannot be given to
any one but God, because man’s life, according to Christ’s teaching, is
the service of God (Matthew 4:10), and one cannot serve two masters
(Matthew 6:24).</p>
<p>Everything carnal a man must give to somebody, and so may give also
to Caesar; but he cannot serve anybody but God.</p>
<p>If men believed in Christ’s teaching, in the teaching of love, they
could not lose all the divine laws revealed by Christ, in order to
fulfil the laws of Caesar.</p>
