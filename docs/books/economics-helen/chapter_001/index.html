            <h1 id="link-2"><span class="chapter-header">Chapter 1</span><br />What is Wealth?</h1><p id="para-3">The Economic definition of Wealth is subtle and difficult to appreciate, but it is absolutely essential to our study to get it clear at the outset and keep it firmly in mind. It is through some muddlement in this original definition of wealth that nearly all mistakes in Economics are made.</p>
<p id="para-4">First, we must be clear as to what Wealth is <em>not.</em></p>
<p id="para-5">Wealth is never properly defined, for the purposes of economic study, by any one of the answers a person would naturally give off-hand. For instance, most people would say that a man’s wealth was the money he was worth. But that, of course, is nonsense; for even if there were no money used his possessions would still be there, and if he had a house and cattle and horses the mere fact that money was not being used where he lived would not make him any worse off.</p>
<p id="para-6">Another and better, but still a wrong, answer is: “Wealth is what a man possesses.”</p>
<p id="para-7">For instance, in the case of this farmer, his house and his stock and his furniture and implements are what we call his “wealth.” In ordinary talk that answer will do well enough. But it will not do for the strict science of Economics, for it is not accurate.</p>
<p id="para-8">For consider a particular case. Part of this man’s wealth is, you say, a certain grey horse. But if you look closely at your definition and make it rigidly accurate, you will find that <em>it is not the horse itself which constitutes his wealth, but something attaching to the horse,</em> some quality or circumstance which affects the horse and gives the horse what is called its <em>value.</em> It is this <em>Value</em> which is wealth, not the horse. To see how true this is consider how the value changes while the horse remains the same.</p>
<p id="para-9">On such and such a date any neighbour would have given the owner of the horse from 20 to 25 sacks of wheat for it, or, say, 10 sheep, or 50 loads of cut wood. But suppose there comes a great mortality among horses, so that very few are left. There is an eager desire to get hold of those that survive in order that the work may be done on the farms. Then the neighbours will be willing to give the owner of the horse much more than 20 or 25 sacks of wheat for it. They may offer as much as 50 sacks, or 20 sheep, or 100 loads of wood. Yet the horse is exactly the same horse it was before. The wealth of the master has increased. His horse, as we say, is “worth more.” <em>It is this</em> <b>Worth</b>, <em>that is, this ability to get other wealth in exchange, which constitutes true Economic Wealth.</em></p>
<p id="para-10">I have told you that the idea is very difficult to seize, and that you will find the hardest part of the study here, at the beginning. There is no way of making it plainer. One has no choice but to master the idea and make oneself familiar with it, difficult as it is. <em>Wealth does not reside in the objects we possess, but in the economic values attaching to those objects.</em></p>
<p id="para-11">We talk of a man’s wealth or a nation’s wealth, or the wealth of the whole world, and we think at once, of course, of a lot of material things: houses and ships, and pictures and furniture, and food and all the rest of it. But the economic wealth which it is our business to study is not identical with those <em>things.</em> Wealth is the sum total of the <em>values</em> attaching to those things.</p>
<p id="para-12">That is the first and most important point.</p>
<p id="para-13">Here is the second: Wealth, for the purposes of economic study, <em>is confined to those values attaching to material objects through the action of man, which values can be exchanged for other values.</em></p>
<p id="para-14">I will explain what that sentence means.</p>
<p id="para-15">Here is a mountain country where there are few people and plenty of water everywhere. That water does not form part of the Economic <em>wealth</em> of anyone living there. Everyone is the better off for the water, but no one has <em>wealth</em> in it. The water they have is absolutely necessary to life, but no man will give anything for it because any man can get it for himself. It has no <em>value in exchange.</em> But in a town to which water has to be brought at great expense of effort, and where the amount is limited, it acquires a value in exchange, that is, people cannot get it without offering something for it. That is why we say that in a modern town water forms part of <em>Economic Wealth,</em> while in the country it usually does not.</p>
<p id="para-16">We must carefully note that wealth thus defined is NOT the same thing as well-being. The mixing up of these two separate things—well-being and economic wealth–—has given rise to half the errors in economic science. People confuse the word “wealth” with the idea of well-being. They say: “Surely a man is better off with plenty of water than with little, and therefore conditions under which he can get plenty of water for nothing are conditions under which he has <em>more wealth</em> than when he has to pay for it. He has more <em>wealth</em> when he gets the water free than he has when he has to pay for it."</p>
<p id="para-17">It is not so. Economic wealth is a separate thing from well-being. Economic wealth may well be increasing though the general well-being of the people is going down. It may increase though the general well-being of the people around it is stationary.</p>
<p id="para-18">The Science of Economics does not deal with true happiness nor even with well-being in material things. It deals with a strictly limited field of what is called “Economic Wealth,” and if it goes outside its own boundaries it goes wrong. Making people as happy as possible is much more than Economics can pretend to. Economics cannot even tell you how to make people well-to-do in material things. But it can tell you how exchangeable Wealth is produced and what happens to it; and as it can tell you this, it is a useful servant.</p>
<p id="para-19">That is the second difficult point at the very beginning of our study. <em>Economic Wealth consists in</em> <b>exchangeable</b> <em>values, and nothing else.</em></p>
<p id="para-20">We must be as clear on this second point as we have made ourselves upon the first, or we 9 hall not make any progress in Economics. They are both of them unfamiliar ideas, and one has to go over them many times before one really grasps them. But they are absolutely essential to this science.</p>
<p id="para-21">Let us sum up this first, elementary, part of our subject, and put it in the shortest terms we can find—–what are called “Formulae,” which means short and exact definitions, such as can be learnt by heart and retained permanently.</p>
<p id="para-22">We write down, then, two Formulae:</p>
<ol>
<li><p id="para-23"><b>Wealth is made up, not of things, but of economic values attaching to things.</b></p>
</li>
<li><p id="para-24"><b>Wealth, for the purposes of economic study, means ONLY exchange values: that is, values against which other values will be given in exchange.</b></p>
</li>
</ol>
