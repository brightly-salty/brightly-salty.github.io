<p>The Franco-Russian celebrations which took place in France, in the
month of October of last year, provoked in me, as no doubt in many other
people, at first a feeling of amusement, then of perplexity, and at last
of indignation, which I intended to express in a short article in a
periodical; but, the more I dwelt on the chief causes of this strange
phenomenon, the more did I arrive at the considerations which I now
offer to my readers.</p>
</section>
<section id="i" class="level1">
<h1>I</h1>
<p>Russians and Frenchmen have lived for many centuries, knowing one
another, entering with one another at times into friendly, more often, I
am sorry to say, into very hostile relations, which have been provoked
by their governments; suddenly, because two years ago a French squadron
arrived at Kronstadt, and the officers of the squadron, upon landing,
ate and drank a lot of wine in various places, hearing and uttering upon
these occasions many lying and stupid words, and because, in the year
1893, a similar Russian squadron arrived at Toulon, and the officers of
the Russian squadron ate and drank a lot in Paris, hearing and uttering
upon that occasion more lying and stupid words than before, it happened
that not only the men who ate, drank, and talked, but even those who
were present, and even those who were not present, but only heard and
read of it in newspapers, all these millions of Russians and Frenchmen
suddenly imagined that they somehow were particularly in love with one
another, that is, that all the French loved all the Russians, and all
the Russians loved all the French.</p>
<p>These sentiments were last October expressed in France in a most
unusual manner.</p>
<p>Here is the way the reception of the Russian sailors is described in
the <em>Rural Messenger</em>, a newspaper which collects its information
from all the others:</p>
<p>“At the meeting of the Russian and French vessels, both, besides the
salvos of guns, greeted one another with hearty, ecstatic shouts,
‘Hurrah,’ ‘Long live Russia,’ ‘Long live France!’</p>
<p>“These were joined by bands of music (which came on many private
steamers), playing the Russian hymn, ‘God save the Tsar,’ and the French
Marseillaise; the public on the private vessels waved their hats, flags,
handkerchiefs, and bouquets; on many barques there were peasants with
their wives and children, and they all had bouquets in their hands, and
even the children waved the bouquets and shouted at the top of their
voices, ‘<em>Vive la Russie!</em>’ Our sailors, upon seeing such
national transport, were unable to restrain their tears…</p>
<p>“In the harbour all the ships-of-war which were then at Toulon were
drawn out in two lines, and our squadron passed between them; in front
was the ironclad of the admiralty, and this was followed by the rest.
There ensued a most solemn minute.</p>
<p>” On the Russian ironclad, fifteen salvos were fired in honour of the
French squadron, and a French ironclad replied with double the number,
with thirty salvos. From the French vessels thundered the sounds of the
Russian hymn. The French sailors climbed up on the sail-yards and masts;
loud exclamations of greeting proceeded uninterruptedly from the two
squadrons and from the private vessels; the caps of the sailors, the
hats and handkerchiefs of the public,—all were thrown up triumphantly in
honour of the dear guests. On all sides, on the water and on the shore,
there boomed one common call, ‘Long live Russia! Long live France!’</p>
<p>“In conformity with naval law, Admiral Avelan and the officers of his
staff landed, in order to greet the local authorities. On the quay the
Russian sailors were met by the chief marine staff of France and the
superior officers of the port of Toulon. There ensued a universal
friendly hand-shaking, accompanied by the boom of cannon and the ringing
of bells. A band of marine music played the hymn ‘God save the Tsar,’
drowned by the thunderous shouts of the public, ‘Long live the Tsar!
Long live Russia!’ These exclamations blended into one mighty sound,
which drowned the music and the salvos from the guns.</p>
<p>“Eye-witnesses declare that at this moment the enthusiasm of the
innumerable mass of people reached its highest limits, and that it is
impossible to express in words with what sensations the hearts of all
those present were filled. Admiral Avelan, with bared head, and
accompanied by Russian and French officers, directed his steps to the
building of the Marine Office, where the French minister of marine was
waiting for him.</p>
<p>“In receiving the admiral, the minister said: ‘Kronstadt and Toulon
are two places which bear witness to the sympathy between the Russian
and the French nations; you will everywhere be met as dear friends. The
government and all of France welcome you upon your arrival and that of
your companions, who represent a great and noble nation.’</p>
<p>“The admiral replied that he was not able to express all his
gratitude. The Russian squadron and all of Russia,’ he said, ‘will
remember the reception you have given us.’</p>
<p>“After a short conversation, the admiral, saying goodbye to the
minister, a second time thanked him for the reception, and added, ‘I do
not want to part from you before pronouncing those words which are
imprinted in all Russian hearts: “Long live France!”’” (<em>Rural
Messenger</em>, 1893, No. 41.)</p>
<p>Such was the meeting at Toulon. In Paris the meeting and the
celebrations were more remarkable still.</p>
<p>Here is the way the meeting in Paris was described in the newspapers:
“All eyes were directed to the Boulevard des Italiens, whence the
Russian sailors were to appear. Finally the boom of a whole hurricane of
exclamations and applauses is heard in the distance. The boom grows
stronger and more audible. The hurricane is apparently approaching. A
mighty motion takes place on the square. Policemen rush forward to clear
a path toward the Cercle Militaire, but this is by no means an easy
task. There is an incredible crush and pressure in the crowd… Finally
the head of the procession appears in the square. At the same moment a
deafening shout, ‘<em>Vive la Russie! Vive les Russes!</em>’ rises over
it. All bare their heads, the public, packed close in the windows, on
the balconies, perched even on the roofs, wave handkerchiefs, flags, and
hats, applaud madly, and from the windows of the upper stories throw
clouds of small many-coloured cockades. A whole sea of handkerchiefs,
hats, and flags surges above the heads of the crowd in the square:
‘<em>Vive la Russie! Vive les Russes!</em>’ shouts this mass of one
hundred thousand people, trying to get a look at the dear guests,
extending their hands to them, and in every way expressing their
sympathies” (<em>New Time</em>).</p>
<p>Another correspondent writes that the transport of the crowd bordered
on delirium. A Russian publicist, who was in Paris at that time,
describes this entrance of the sailors in the following manner: “They
tell the truth,—it was an incident of world-wide import, wondrous,
touching, soul-stirring, making the heart quiver with that love which
discerns the brothers in men, and which detests bloodshed and
concomitant acts of violence, the tearing away of the children from
their beloved mother. I have been in some kind of an intoxication for
several hours. I felt so strange, and even so weak, as I stood at the
station of the Lyons Railway, among the representatives of the French
administration in their gold-embroidered uniforms, among the members of
the municipality in full dress, and heard the shouts, ‘<em>Vive la
Russie! Vive le Czar!</em>’ and our national hymn, which was played
several times in succession. Where am I? What has happened? What magic
stream has united all this into one feeling, into one mind? Does one not
feel here the presence of the God of love and brotherhood, the presence
of something higher, something ideal, which descends upon men only in
lofty moments? The heart is so full of something beautiful and pure and
exalted, that the pen is not able to express it all. Words pale before
what I saw, what I felt. It is not transport,—the word is too banal,—it
is something better than transport. It is more picturesque, profounder,
more joyous, more varied. It is impossible to describe what happened at
the Cercle Militaire, when Admiral Avelan appeared on the balcony of a
second story. Words will not tell anything here. During the Te Deum,
when the choristers sang in the church ‘Save, O Lord, thy people,’ there
burst through the open door the solemn sounds of the Marseillaise, which
was played in the street by an orchestra of wind-instruments. There was
something astounding and inexpressible in the impression conveyed”
(<em>New Time</em>, October, 1893).</p>

<h1>II</h1>
<p>After arriving in France, the Russian sailors for two weeks went from
one celebration to another, and in the middle or at the end of every
celebration they ate, drank, and talked; and the information as to what
they ate and drank on Wednesday and where and what on Friday, and what
was said upon that occasion, was wired home and conveyed to the whole of
Russia. The moment some Russian captain drank the health of France, this
at once became known to the whole world, and the moment the Russian
admiral said, “I drink to fair France!” these words were immediately
borne over the whole world. But more than that: the scrupulousness of
the newspapers was such that they reported not only the toasts, but even
many dinners, with the cakes and appetizers which were used at these
dinners.</p>
<p>Thus it said in one issue of a newspaper that the dinner was “an
artistic production:”</p>
<blockquote>
<p> Consommé de volailles, petits pâtés</p>
<p>Mousse de hommard parisienne</p>
<p>Noisette de boeuf à la béarnaise</p>
<p>Faisans à la Périgord</p>
<p>Casseroles de truffes au champagne</p>
<p>Chaufroid de volailles a la Toulouse</p>
<p>Salade russe</p>
<p>Croute de fruits toulonaise</p>
<p>Parfait a l’ananas</p>
<p>Desserts</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the next number it said:</p>
<p>“In a culinary sense the dinner left nothing to be desired. The menu
consisted of the following:</p>
<blockquote>
<p> Potage livonien et St. Germain</p>
<p>Zéphyrs Nantua</p>
<p>Esturgeon braisé moldave</p>
<p>Selle de daguet grand veneur,</p>
</blockquote>
<p>and so forth.</p>
<p>The next number described another menu. With every menu a detailed
description was given of the wines which the feted men consumed,—such
and such “voodka” such and such <em>Bourgogne vieux</em>, <em>Grand
Moët</em>, and so forth. In an English paper there was an account of all
the intoxicants consumed by the celebrators. This amount is so enormous
that it is doubtful if all the drunkards of Russia and of France could
have drunk so much in so short a time.</p>
<p>They reported also the speeches which were made by the celebrators,
but the menus were more varied than the speeches. The speeches consisted
invariably of the same words in all kinds of combinations and
permutations. The meaning of these words was always one and the same:
“We love one another tenderly, we are in transport, because we have so
suddenly fallen in love with one another. Our aim is not war and not
<em>revanche</em>, and not the return of provinces taken, but only
<em>peace</em>, the benefaction of <em>peace</em>, the security of
<em>peace</em>, the rest and <em>peace</em> of Europe. Long live the
Emperor of Russia and the empress,—we love them and we love
<em>peace</em>. Long live the president of the republic and his wife,—we
love them, too, and we love <em>peace</em>. Long live France, Russia,
their fleets, and their armies. We love the army, too, and
<em>peace</em>, and the chief of the squadron.” The speeches generally
ended, as in couplets, with the words,“Toulon, Kronstadt,” or
“Kronstadt, Toulon.” And the names of these places, where so much food
was eaten and so many kinds of wine were consumed, were pronounced like
words reminding one of the loftiest, most valorous of acts of the
representatives of both nations, words after which there was nothing
else to be said, because everything was comprehensible. “We love one
another, and we love peace. Kronstadt, Toulon!”What else can be added to
this? Especially with the accompaniment of solemn music, playing
simultaneously two hymns, one—praising the Tsar and asking God for all
kinds of benefactions for him, and the other—cursing all kings and
promising their ruin.</p>
<p>The men who expressed their sentiments of love particularly well
received decorations and reward; other men for the same services, or
simply out of a superabundance of feelings, were given the strangest and
most unexpected presents,—thus the Emperor of Russia received from the
French squadron some kind of a golden book, in which, I think, nothing
was written, and if there was, it was something that nobody needed to
know, and the chief of the Russian squadron received, among other
presents, a still more remarkable object, an aluminum plough, covered
with flowers, and many other just as unexpected presents.</p>
<p>Besides, all these strange acts were accompanied by still stranger
religious ceremonies and public prayers, which, it would seem, the
French had long ago outlived. Since the days of the Concordat there had
hardly been offered so many prayers as in that short time. All the
French suddenly became unusually pious, and carefully hung up in the
rooms of the Russian sailors those very images which they had just as
carefully removed from their schools, as being harmful tools of
superstition, and they kept praying all the time. Cardinals and bishops
everywhere prescribed prayers, and themselves prayed, uttering the
strangest prayers. Thus the Bishop of Toulon at the launching of the
ironclad <em>Joriguiberi</em> prayed to the God of peace, making people
feel, however, that, if it came to a pinch, he could address also the
God of war.</p>
<p>“What her fate will be,” said the bishop, in reference to the
ironclad, “God alone knows. No one knows whether she will belch forth
death from her appalling bosom. But if, invoking now the God of peace,
we should later have occasion to invoke the God of war, we are firmly
convinced that the <em>Joriguiberi</em> will go forth side by side with
the mighty boats whose crews have this day entered into such a close
fraternal union with our own. Far from us be such a prospect, and may
the present festivity leave nothing but a peaceful recollection, like
the recollection of the <em>Grand Duke Constantine</em>, which was
present here (in 1857) at the launching of the ship <em>Quirinal</em>,
and may the friendship of France and of Russia make these two nations
the guardians of peace.”</p>
<p>In the meantime tens of thousands of telegrams flew from Russia to
France, and from France to Russia. French women greeted Russian women.
Russian women expressed their gratitude to the French women. A troupe of
Russian actors greeted some French actors, and the French actors
informed them that they harboured deeply in their hearts the greeting of
the Russian actors. Some Russian candidates for judicial positions, who
served in a Circuit Court of some town or other, expressed their
enthusiasm for the French nation. General So and So thanked Madame So
and So, and Madame So and So assured General So and So of her sentiments
for the Russian nation; Russian children wrote verses of welcome to
French children, and the French children answered in verse and in prose;
the Russian minister of education assured the French minister of
education of the sentiments of sudden love for the French, which were
experienced by all the children, scholars, and authors subject to his
ministry; members of a society for the protection of animals expressed
their ardent attachment for the French, and so did the Council of the
City of Kazán.</p>
<p>The canon of the eparchy of Arras informed his Worship, the chief
priest of the Russian court clergy, that he could affirm that deep in
the hearts of all the French cardinals and archbishops there was
imprinted a love for Russia and his Majesty Alexander III. and his most
august family, and that the Russian and French clergy professed almost
the selfsame religion and equally honoured the Virgin; to which his
Worship, the chief priest, replied that the prayers of the French clergy
for the most august family re-echoed joyfully in the hearts of the whole
Russian Tsar-loving family, and that, since the Russian people also
worshipped the Holy Virgin, it could count on France in life and in
death. Almost the same information was vouchsafed by different generals,
telegraph operators, and dealers in groceries. Everybody congratulated
somebody on something and thanked somebody for something.</p>
<p>The excitement was so great that the most unusual acts were
committed, but no one observed their unusual character, and all, on the
contrary, approved of them, went into ecstasies over them, and, as
though fearing lest they should be too late, hastened to commit similar
acts, so as not to fall behind the rest. If protests were expressed in
words and in writing and in printing against these mad acts, pointing
out their irrationality, such protests were concealed or squelched.</p>
<p>Thus I know of the following protest of students, sent to Paris,
which was not accepted by a single newspaper:</p>
<blockquote>
<p> </p>
<p>Lately a group of Moscow students of law, with the university
authorities at their head, took it upon themselves to speak in behalf of
all the student body of Moscow University in respect to the Toulon
festivities.</p>
<p>We, the representatives of the association of student societies,
protest in the most emphatic manner possible both against the arrogation
of this group and substantially against the exchange of civilities
between it and the French students. We, too, look with ardent love and
profound respect upon France, and we do so, because we see in it a great
nation, which formerly used to appear before the whole world as the
herald and proclaimer of great ideals of liberty, equality, and
fraternity; and which was also the first in the matter of bold endeavour
for the materialization of these great ideals,—and the best part of the
Russian youth has always been ready to welcome France as the leading
champion for the best future of humanity; but we do not consider such
festivities as those of Kronstadt and Toulon a suitable occasion for
such civilities.</p>
<p>On the contrary, these festivities signal a sad but, let us hope,
temporary phenomenon,—the disloyalty of France to its former great
historic role: the country, which once called the whole world to break
the fetters of despotism and offered its fraternal aid to every nation
that revolted for the sake of its freedom, now burns incense before the
Russian government, which systematically trigs the normal, organic, and
vital growth of the national life, and mercilessly crushes, without
stopping at anything, all the strivings of Russian society toward the
light, toward freedom, and toward independence. The Toulon
manifestations are one of the acts of that drama which is presented by
the antagonism—the creation of Napoleon III and Bismarck—between two
great nations, France and Germany. This antagonism keeps all of Europe
under arms, and makes the Russian absolutism, which has always been the
stay of despotism and arbitrariness against freedom, of the exploiters
against the exploited, the executor of the political destinies of the
world. A sensation of anguish for our country, of pity for the blindness
of a considerable part of French society, such are the sensations evoked
in us by these festivities.</p>
<p>We are fully convinced that the young generation of France will not
be carried away by the national Chauvinism, and that, prepared to
struggle for that better social structure toward which humanity is
marching, it will know how to render to itself an account of the present
events and to take the proper stand about them; we hope that our fervent
protest will find a sympathetic echo in the hearts of the French
youth.</p>
<p>The union council of twenty-four united Moscow student
societies.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To say nothing of all the millions of work-days which were wasted on
these festivities, of the wholesale drunkenness of all the participants,
which was encouraged by all the powers, to say nothing of the insipidity
of the speeches made, the maddest and most cruel things were done, and
no one paid any attention to them.</p>
<p>Thus several dozens of men were crushed to death, and no one found it
necessary to mention this fact. One correspondent wrote that a Frenchman
told him at a ball that now there could hardly be found a woman in Paris
who would not be false to her duties, in order to satisfy the wishes of
some Russian sailor—and all this passed by unnoticed, as something that
ought to be. There occurred cases of distinct madness. Thus one woman,
dressing herself in a garment of the colours of the Franco-Russian
flags, waited for the sailors and, exclaiming, “<em>Vive la
Russie!</em>” jumped from the bridge into the river and was drowned.</p>
<p>Women in general played in these festivities a prominent part and
even guided the men. Besides throwing flowers and all kinds of ribbons,
and offering presents and addresses, French women made for the Russian
sailors and kissed them; some of them for some reason brought their
children to them, to be kissed by them, and when the Russian sailors
complied with their wish, all persons present went into ecstasies and
wept.</p>
<p>This strange excitement was so infectious that, as one correspondent
tells, an apparently absolutely sound Russian sailor, after two days of
contemplation of what took place around him, in the middle of the day
jumped from the ship into the sea and, swimming, shouted, “<em>Vive la
France!</em>” When he was taken aboard and asked why he had done so, he
replied that he had made a vow that in honour of France he would swim
around the ship.</p>
<p>Thus the undisturbed excitement grew and grew, like a ball of rolling
wet snow, and finally reached such dimensions that not only the persons
present, not only predisposed, weak-nerved, but even strong, normal men
fell a prey to the general mood and became abnormally affected.</p>
<p>I remember how I, absent-mindedly reading one of these descriptions
of the solemnity of the reception of the sailors, suddenly felt a
feeling, akin to meekness of spirit, even a readiness for tears,
communicated to me, so that I had to make an effort to overcome this
feeling.</p>

<section id="iii" class="level1">
<h1>III</h1>
<p>Lately Sikórski, a professor of psychiatry, described in the <em>Kiev
University Record</em> the psychopathic epidemic, as he calls it, of the
Malévannians, as manifested in a few villages of Vasilkóv County of the
Government of Kiev. The essence of this epidemic, as Mr. Sikórski, the
investigator of it, says, consisted in this, that certain persons of
these villages, under the influence of their leader, by the name of
Malévanny, came to imagine that the end of the world was at hand, and
so, changing their whole mode of life, began to distribute their
property, to dress up, and to eat savoury food, and stopped working. The
professor found the condition of these men to be abnormal. He says:
“Their unusual good nature frequently passed into exaltation, a joyous
condition, which was devoid of external motives. They were sentimentally
disposed: excessively polite, talkative, mobile, with tears of joy
appearing easily and just as easily disappearing. They sold their
necessaries, in order to provide themselves with umbrellas, silk
kerchiefs, and similar objects, and at that the kerchiefs served them
only as ornaments for their toilet. They ate many sweet things. They
were always in a cheerful mood, and they led an idle life,—visited one
another, walked together… When the obviously absurd character of their
refusal to work was pointed out to them, one every time heard in reply
the stereotyped phrase, ‘If I want to, I shall work, and if I do not
want to, why should I compel myself?’”</p>
<p>The learned professor considers the condition of these men a
pronounced case of a psychopathic epidemic, and, advising the government
to take certain measures against its spread, ends his communication with
the words: “Malévannism is the wail of a morbidly sick population and a
supplication to be freed from liquor and to have education and sanitary
conditions improved.”</p>
<p>But if Malevannism is the wail of a morbidly sick population and a
supplication to be freed from liquor and from harmful social conditions,
then this new disease, which has appeared in Paris and has with alarming
rapidity embraced a great part of the city population of France and
almost the whole of governmental and cultured Russia, is just such an
alarming wail of a morbid population and just such a supplication to be
freed from liquor and from false social conditions.</p>
<p>And if we must admit that the psychopathic suffering of Malevannism
is dangerous, and that the government has done well to follow the
professor’s advice and remove the leaders of Malevannism by confining
some of them in lunatic asylums and monasteries and by deporting others
to distant places, how much more dangerous must be considered to be this
new epidemic, which appeared in Toulon and Paris and from there spread
over the whole of France and of Russia, and how much more necessary it
is, if not for the government, at least for society, to take decisive
measures against the spread of such epidemics!</p>
<p>The resemblance between the diseases is complete. There is the same
good nature, passing into causeless and joyful exaltation, the same
sentimentality, excessive politeness, talkativeness, the same constant
tears of meekness of spirit, which come and go without cause, the same
festive mood, the same walking for pleasure and visiting one another,
the same dressing up in the best clothes, the same proneness for sweet
food, the same senseless talks, the same idleness, the same singing and
music, the same leadership of the women, and the same clownish phase of
<em>attitudes passionnelles</em>, which Mr. Sikórski has noticed in the
case of the Malévannians; that is, as I understand this word, those
different, unnatural poses, which men assume during solemn meetings,
receptions, and after-dinner speeches.</p>
<p>The resemblance is complete. The only difference is this,—and the
difference is very great for the society in which these phenomena are
taking place,—that there it is the aberration of a few dozen peaceful,
poor village people, who live on their small means and, therefore,
cannot exert any violence on their neighbours, and who infect others
only by the personal and oral transmission of their mood, while here it
is the aberration of millions of people, who possess enormous sums of
money and means for exerting violence against other people,—guns,
bayonets, fortresses, ironclads, melinite, dynamite, and who, besides,
have at their command the most energetic means for the dissemination of
their madness, the post, the telegraph, an enormous number of
newspapers, and all kinds of publications, which are printed without
cessation and carry the infection to all the corners of the globe. There
is also this difference, that the first not only do not get themselves
drunk, but even do not use any intoxicating liquor, while the second are
constantly in a state of semi-intoxication, which they never stop
maintaining in themselves. And so for a society in which these phenomena
are taking place, there is the same difference between the Kíev
epidemic, during which, according to Mr. Sikorski’s information, it does
not appear that they commit any violence or murders, and the one which
made its appearance in Paris, where in one procession twenty women were
crushed to death, as there is between a piece of coal, which has leaped
out of the stove and is glowing on the floor without igniting it, and a
fire which is already enveloping the door and walls of the house. In the
worst case the consequences of the Kíev epidemic will consist in this,
that the peasants of one millionth part of Russia will spend what they
have earned by hard labour, and will be unable to pay the Crown taxes;
but the consequences from the Toulon-Paris epidemic, which is embracing
men who are in possession of a terrible power, of vast sums of money,
and of implements of violence and of the dissemination of their madness,
can and must be terrible.</p>

<p>We can with pity listen to the delirium of a feeble, defenceless,
crazy old man, in his cap and cloak, and even not contradict him, and
even jestingly agree with him; but when it is a whole crowd of sound
insane people, who have broken away from their confinement, and these
people bristle from head to foot with sharp daggers, swords, and loaded
revolvers, and madly flourish these death-dealing weapons, we can no
longer agree with them, and we cannot be at rest even for a minute. The
same is true of that condition of excitement, provoked by the French
celebrations, in which Russian and French society finds itself at the
present time.</p>
<p>It is true, in all the speeches, in all the toasts, pronounced at
these celebrations, in all the articles concerning these celebrations,
they never stopped talking of the importance of everything which was
taking place for the guarantee of peace. Even the advocates of war did
not speak of hatred of those who snatch away provinces, but of some kind
of a love which somehow hates.</p>
<p>But we know of the slyness of all men who are mentally diseased, and
it is this most persistent repetition of our not wanting war, but peace,
and the reticence regarding that of which all think, that form a most
menacing phenomenon.</p>
<p>In answering a toast at a dinner given in the Palace of the Élysées,
the Russian ambassador said: “Before drinking a toast to which will
respond from the depth of their hearts, not only those who are within
these walls, but even those—and, that, too, with equal force—whose
hearts near by and far away, at all the points of great, fair France, as
also in all of Russia, at the present moment are beating in unison with
ours,—permit me to offer to you the expression of our profoundest
gratitude for the words of welcome which were addressed by you to our
admiral, whom our Tsar has charged with the mission of paying back your
visit at Kronstadt. Considering the high importance which you enjoy,
your words characterize the true significance of the magnificent
<em>peaceful</em> festivities, which are celebrated with such wonderful
unanimity, loyalty, and sincerity.”</p>
<p>The same unjustifiable mention of peace is found in the speech of the
French president: “The ties of love, which unite Russia and France,” he
said, “and which two years ago were strengthened by touching
manifestations, of which our fleet was the object at Kronstadt, become
tighter and tighter with every day, and the honourable exchange of our
amicable sentiments must inspire all those who take to heart the
benefactions of peace, confidence, and security,” and so forth.</p>
<p>Both speeches quite unexpectedly and without any cause refer to the
benefactions of peace and to peaceful celebrations.</p>
<p>The same occurs in the telegrams which were exchanged between the
Emperor of Russia and the President of France. The Emperor of Russia
telegraphed:</p>
<p>“<em>Au moment oil l’escadre russe quitte la France, it me tient a
coeur de vous exprimer combien je suis touche et reconnaissant de
I’accueil chaleureux et splendide, que mes marins out trouve partout sur
le sol français. Les témoignages de vive sympathie qui se sont
manifestos encore une fois avec tant d’eloquence, joindront un nouveau
lien a ceux qui unissent les deux pays et contribueront, je l’espère, a
l’affermissement de la paix generale, objet de leurs efforts et de leurs
vœux les plus constants</em>” etc.</p>
<p>The President of France in his reply telegraphed as follows:</p>
<p>“<em>La dépêche dont je remercie votre Majesté m’est parvenue au
moment ou je quittais Toulon pour rentrer a Paris. La belle escadre sur
laquelle fai en la vive satisfaction de saluer le pavilion russe dans
les eaux françaises, l’accueil cordial et spontané que vos braves marins
ont rencontre partout en France affirment une fois de plus avec eclat
les sympathies sincères qui unissent nos deux pays. Ils marquent en même
temps une foi profonde dans l’influence bienfaisante que peuvent exercer
ensemble deux grandes nations dévouées à la cause de la paix.</em>”</p>
<p>Again there is in both telegrams a gratuitous mention of peace, which
has nothing in common with the celebrations of the sailors.</p>
<p>There is not one speech, not one article, in which mention is not
made of this, that the aim of all these past orgies is the peace of
Europe. At a dinner, which is given by the representatives of the
Russian press, everybody speaks of peace. Mr. Zola, who lately wrote
about the necessity and even usefulness of war, and Mr. Vogue, who more
than once expressed the same idea, do not say one word about war, but
speak only of peace. The meetings of the Chambers are opened with
speeches respecting the past celebrations, and the orators affirm that
these festivities are the declaration of the peace of Europe.</p>
<p>It is as though a man, coming into some peaceful society, should go
out of his way on every occasion to assure the persons present that he
has not the slightest intention of knocking out anybody’s teeth,
smashing eyes, or breaking arms, but means only to pass a peaceable
evening. “But nobody has any doubts about that,” one feels like saying
to him. ” But if you have such base intentions, at least do not dare
speak of them to us.”</p>
<p>In many articles, which were written about these celebrations, there
is even a direct and naive expression of pleasure, because during the
festivities no one gave utterance to what by tacit consent it had been
decided to conceal from, everybody, and what only one incautious man,
who was immediately removed by the police, dared to shout, giving
expression to the secret thought of all, namely, “<em>A bas
l’Allemagne!</em>” Thus children are frequently so happy at having
concealed their naughtiness, that their very joy gives them away.</p>
<p>Why should we so rejoice at the fact that no mention was made of war,
if we indeed are not thinking of it?</p>
</section>
<section id="v" class="level1">
<h1>V</h1>
<p>No one is thinking of war, but yet milliards are wasted on military
preparations, and, millions of men are under arms in Russia and in
France.</p>
<p>“But all this is being done for the security of peace. <em>Si vis
pacem, para helium. L’empire c’est la paix, la république c’est la
paix.</em>”</p>
<p>But if it is so, why are the military advantages of our alliance with
France in case of a war with Germany explained, not only in all the
periodicals and newspapers published for the so-called cultured people,
but also in the <em>Rural Messenger</em>, a newspaper published by the
Russian government for the masses, by means of which these unfortunate
masses, deceived by the government, are impressed with this, that ” to
be friendly with France is also useful and profitable, because, if,
beyond all expectation, the above-mentioned powers (Germany, Austria,
Italy) should decide to violate the peace with Russia, Russia, though
able with God’s aid to protect itself and handle a very powerful
alliance of adversaries, would not find this to be an easy task, and for
a successful struggle great sacrifices and losses would be needed,” and
so forth (<em>Rural Messenger</em>, No. 43, 1893).</p>
<p>And why do they in all the French colleges teach history from a
text-book composed by Mr. Lavisse, twenty-first edition, 1889, in which
the following passage is found:</p>
<p>“<em>Depuis que l’insurrection de la Commune a été vaincue, la France
n’a plus été troublée. Au lendemain de la guerre, elle s’est remise au
travail. Elle a payé aux Allemands sans difficulté l’énorme contribution
de guerre de cinq milliards. Mais la France a perdu sa renommée
militaire pendant la guerre de 1870. Elle a perdu une partie de son
territoire. Plus de quinze cents mille hommes, qui habitaient nos
départements die Haut Rhin, du Bas Rhin et de la Moselle, et qui étaient
de bons Français, ont été obligés de devenir Allemands. Ils ne sont pas
résignés a leur sort. Ils détestent l’Allemagne; ils espèrent toujours
redevenir Français. Mais l’Allemagne tient a sa conquête, et e’est un
grand pays, dont tous les habitants aiment sincèrement leur patrie et
dont les soldats sont braves et disciplines. Pour reprendre à
l’Allemagne ce qu’elle nous a pris, il faut que nous soyons de bons
citoyens et de bons soldats. C’est pour que vous deveniez de bons
soldats, que vos maitres vous apprennent l’histoire de la France.
L’histoire de la France montre que dans notre pays les fils ont toujours
vengé les désastres de leurs pères. Les Français du temps de Charles VII
ont vengé leurs pères vaincus à Crécy, à Poitiers, à Agincourt. C’est à
vous, enfants élèves aujourd’hui dans nos écoles, qu’il appartient de
venger vos pères, vaincus à Sedan et à Metz. C’est votre devoir, le
grand devoir de votre vie. Vous devez y penser toujours,</em>” etc.</p>
<p>At the foot of the page there is a whole series of questions, to
correspond to the articles. The questions are as follows: “What did
France lose when she lost part of her territory? How many Frenchmen
became German with the loss of this territory? Do the French love
Germany? What must we do, in order to regain what was taken away from us
by Germany?” In addition to these there are also “<em>Réflexions sur le
Livre VII</em>,” in which it says that ” the children of France must
remember our defeats of 1870,” that “they must feel on their hearts the
burden of this memory,” but that “this memory must not discourage them:
it should, on the contrary, incite them to bravery.”</p>
<p>Thus, if in official speeches peace is mentioned with great
persistency, the masses, the younger generations, yes, all the Russians
and Frenchmen in general, are imperturbably impressed with the
necessity, legality, profitableness, and even virtue of war.</p>
<p>“We are not thinking of war,—we are concerned only about peace.”</p>
<p>One feels like asking “<em>Qui, diable, trompe-t-on ici?</em>” if it
were necessary to ask this, and if it were not quite clear who the
unfortunate cheated are.</p>
<p>The cheated are the same eternally deceived, stupid, labouring
masses, the same who with their callous hands have built all these
ships, and fortresses, and arsenals, and barracks, and guns, and
steamboats, and quays, and moles, and all these palaces, halls, and
platforms, and triumphal arches; and have set and printed all these
newspapers and books; and have secured and brought all those pheasants,
and ortolans, and oysters, and wines, which are consumed by all those
men, whom they, again, have nurtured and brought up and sustained,—men
who, deceiving the masses, prepare the most terrible calamities for
them; the same good-natured, stupid masses, who, displaying their sound,
white teeth, have grinned in childish fashion, naively enjoying the
sight of all the dressed-up admirals and presidents, of the flags
fluttering above them, the fireworks, the thundering music, and who will
hardly have time to look around, when there shall be no longer any
admirals, nor presidents, nor flags, nor music, but there will be only a
wet, waste field, hunger, cold, gloom, in front the slaying enemy,
behind the goading authorities, blood, wounds, sufferings, rotting
corpses, and a senseless, useless death.</p>
<p>And the men like those who now are celebrating at the festivities in
Toulon and Paris, will be sitting, after a good dinner, with unfinished
glasses of good wine, with a cigar between their teeth, in a dark cloth
tent, and will with pins mark down the places on the map where so much
food for cannon, composed of the masses, should be left, in order to
seize such and such a fortress, and in order to obtain such or such a
ribbon or promotion.</p>

<p>“But there is nothing of the kind, and there are no warlike
intentions,” we are told. “All there is, is that two nations feeling a
mutual sympathy are expressing this sentiment to one another. What harm
is there in this, that the representatives of a friendly nation were
received with especial solemnity and honour by the representatives of
the other nation? What harm is there in it, even if it be admitted that
the alliance may have the significance of a protection against a
dangerous neighbour, threatening the peace of Europe?”</p>
<p>The harm is this, that all this is a most palpable and bold lie, an
unjustifiable, bad lie. The sudden outburst of an exclusive love of the
Russians for the French, and of the French for the Russians, is a lie;
and our hatred for the Germans, our distrust of them, which is
understood by it, is also a lie. And the statement that the aim of all
these indecent and mad orgies is the guarantee of European peace, is a
still greater lie.</p>
<p>We all know that we have experienced no particular love for the
French, neither before, nor even now, even as we have not experienced
any hostile feeling toward the Germans.</p>
<p>We are told that Germany has some intentions against Russia, that the
Triple Alliance threatens the peace of Europe and us, and that our
alliance with France balances the forces, and so guarantees the peace.
But this assertion is so obviously absurd, that it makes one feel
ashamed to give it a serious denial. For this to be so, that is, for the
alliance to guarantee peace, it is necessary that the forces be
mathematically even. If now the excess is on the side of the
Franco-Russian alliance, the danger is still the same. It is even
greater, because, if there was a danger that William, who stood at the
head of the European alliance, would violate the peace, there is a much
greater danger that France, which cannot get used to the loss of her
provinces, will do so. The Triple Alliance was called a league of peace,
but for us it was a league of war. Even so now the Franco-Russian
alliance cannot present itself as anything else than what it is,—a
league of war.</p>
<p>And then, if peace depends on the balance of the powers, how are the
units to be determined, between whom the balance is to be established?
Now the English say that the alliance between Russia and France menaces
them, and that they must, therefore, form another alliance. And into how
many units of alliances must Europe be divided, in order that there be a
balance? If so, then every man stronger than another in society is
already a danger, and the others must form into alliances, to withstand
him.</p>
<p>They ask, “What harm is there in this, that France and Russia have
expressed their mutual sympathies for the guarantee of peace?” What is
bad is, that it is a lie, and a lie is never spoken with impunity, and
does not pass unpunished.</p>
<p>The devil is a slayer of men and the father of lies. And the lies
always lead to the slaying of men,—in this case more obviously than
ever.</p>
<p>In just the same manner as now, the Turkish war was preceded by a
sudden outburst of love of our Russians for their brothers, the Slavs,
whom no one had known for hundreds of years, while the Germans, the
French, the English have always been incomparably nearer and more
closely related to us than Montenegrins, Serbians, or Bulgarians. And
there began transports, receptions, and festivities, which were fanned
by such men as Aksákov and Katkóv, who are mentioned now in Paris as
models of patriotism. Then, as now, they spoke of nothing but the mutual
sudden outburst of love between the Russians and the Slavs. In the
beginning they ate and drank in Moscow, even as now in Paris, and talked
nonsense to one another, becoming affected by their own exalted
sentiments, spoke of union and peace, and did not say anything about the
chief thing, the intentions against Turkey. The newspapers fanned the
excitement, and the government by degrees entered into the game. Servia
revolted. There began an exchange of diplomatic notes and the
publication of semi-official articles; the newspapers lied more and
more, invented and waxed wroth, and the end of it all was that Alexander
II, who really did not want any war, could not help but agree to it, and
we all know what happened: the destruction of hundreds of thousands of
innocent people and the bestialization and dulling of millions.</p>
<p>What was done in Toulon and in Paris, and now continues to be done in
the newspapers, obviously leads to the same, or to a still more terrible
calamity. Just so all kinds of generals and ministers will at first, to
the sounds of “God save the Tsar” and the Marseillaise drink the health
of France, of Russia, of the various regiments of the army and the navy;
the newspapers will print their lies; the idle crowd of the rich, who do
not know what to do with their powers and with their time, will babble
patriotic speeches, fanning hatred against Germany, and no matter how
peaceful Alexander III may be, the conditions will be such that he will
be unable to decline a war which will be demanded by all those who
surround him, by all the newspapers, and, as always seems, by the public
opinion of the j whole nation. And before we shall have had time to look
around, there will appear in the columns of the newspapers the usual,
ominous, stupid proclamation:</p>
<p>“By God’s grace, we, the most autocratic great Emperor of all Russia,
the King of Poland, the Grand Duke of Finland, etc., etc., inform all
our faithful subjects that for the good of these dear subjects,
entrusted to us by God, we have considered it our duty before God to
send them out to slaughter. God be with them,” and so forth.</p>
<p>The bells will be rung, and long-haired men will throw
gold-embroidered bags over themselves and will begin to pray for the
slaughter. And there will begin again the old, well-known, terrible
deed. The newspaper writers, who under the guise of patriotism stir
people up to hatred and murder, will be about, in the hope of double
earnings. Manufacturers, merchants, purveyors of military supplies, will
bestir themselves joyfully, expecting double profits. All kinds of
officials will bestir themselves, foreseeing a chance to steal more than
they usually do. The military authorities will bestir themselves, for
they will receive double salaries and rations, and will hope to get for
the killing of people all kinds of trifles, which they value very
much,—ribbons, crosses, galloons, stars. Idle gentlemen and ladies will
bestir themselves, inscribing themselves in advance in the Red Cross,
preparing themselves to dress the wounds of those whom their own
husbands and brothers will kill, and imagining that they are thus doing
a most Christian work.</p>
<p>And, drowning in their hearts their despair by means of songs,
debauches, and vodka, hundreds of thousands of simple, good people, torn
away from peaceful labour, from their wives, mothers, children, will
march, with weapons of murder in their hands, whither they will be
driven. They will go to freeze, to starve, to be sick, to die from
diseases, and finally they will arrive at the place where they will be
killed by the thousand, and they will kill by the thousand, themselves
not knowing why, men whom they have never seen and who have done them
and can do them no harm.</p>
<p>And when there shall be collected so many sick, wounded, and killed
that nobody will have the time to pick them up, and when the air shall
already be so infected by this rotting food for cannon that even the
authorities will feel uncomfortable, then they will stop for awhile,
will somehow manage to pick up the wounded, will haul off and somewhere
throw into a pile the sick, and will bury the dead, covering them with
lime, and again they will lead on the whole crowd of the deceived, and
will continue to lead them on in this manner until those who have
started the whole thing will get tired of it, or until those who needed
it will get what they needed. And again will men become infuriated,
brutalized, and bestialized, and love will be diminished in the world,
and the incipient Christianization of humanity will be delayed for
decades and for centuries. And again will the people, who gain thereby,
begin to say with assurance that, if there is a war, this means that it
is necessary, and again they will begin to prepare for it the future
generations, by corrupting them from childhood.</p>

<p>And so, when there appear such patriotic manifestations as were the
Toulon celebrations, which, though still at a distance, in advance bind
the wills of men and oblige them to commit those customary malefactions
which always result from patriotism, every one who understands the
significance of these celebrations cannot help but protest against
everything which is tacitly included in them. And so, when the
journalists say in print that all the Russians sympathize with what took
place at Kronstadt, Toulon, and Paris; that this alliance for life and
death is confirmed by the will of the whole nation; and when the Russian
minister of education assures the French ministers that his whole
company, the Russian children, the learned, and the authors, share his
sentiments; or when the commander of the Russian squadron assures the
French that the whole of Russia will be grateful to them for their
reception; and when the chief priests speak for their flocks and assure
the French that their prayers for the life of the most august house have
re-echoed joyfully in the hearts of the Russian <em>Tsar-loving</em>
nation; and when the Russian ambassador in Paris, who is considered to
be the representative of the Russian nation, says after a dinner of
<em>ortolans à la soubise et logopèdes glaces</em>, with a glass of
champagne Grand Moe’t in his hand, that all Russian hearts are beating
in unison with his heart, which is filled with a sudden outburst of
exclusive love for fair France (<em>la belle France</em>),—we, the
people who are free from the stultification, consider it our sacred
duty, not only for our own sakes, but also for the sake of tens of
millions of Russians, in the most emphatic manner to protest against it
and to declare that our hearts do not beat in unison with the hearts of
the journalists, ministers of education, commanders of squadrons, chief
priests, and ambassadors, but, on the contrary, are full to the brim
with indignation and loathing for that harmful lie and that evil which
they consciously and unconsciously disseminate with their acts and their
speeches. Let them drink <em>Moët</em> as much as they please, and let
them write articles and deliver addresses in their own name, but we, all
the Christians, who recognize ourselves as such, cannot admit that we
are bound by everything that these men say and write. We cannot admit
it, because we know what is concealed beneath all these drunken
transports, speeches, and embraces, which do not resemble the
confirmation of peace, as we are assured, but rather those orgies and
that drunkenness to which evil-doers abandon themselves when they
prepare themselves for a joint crime.</p>

<h1>VIII</h1>
<p>About four years ago,—the first swallow of the Toulon spring,—a
certain French agitator in favour of a war with Germany came to Russia
for the purpose of preparing the Franco-Russian alliance, and he visited
us in the country. He arrived at our house when we were working in the
mowing. At breakfast, as we returned home, we made the acquaintance of
the guest, and he immediately proceeded to tell us how he had fought,
had been in captivity, had run away from it, and how he had made a
patriotic vow, of which he was apparently proud, that he would not stop
agitating a war against Germany until the integrity and glory of France
should be re-established.</p>
<p>In our circle all the convictions of our guest as to how necessary an
alliance between Russia and France was for the re-establishment of the
former borders of France and its might and glory, and for making us
secure against the malevolent intentions of Germany, were of no avail to
him. In reply to his arguments that France could not be at peace so long
as the provinces taken from it were not returned to it, we said that
similarly Prussia could not be at rest, so long as it had not paid back
for Jena, and that, if the French “<em>revanche</em>” should now be
successful, the Germans would have to pay them back, and so on without
end.</p>
<p>In reply to his arguments that the French were obliged to save their
brothers, who had been torn away from them, we said that the condition
of the inhabitants, of the majority of the inhabitants, of the working
people in Alsace-Lorraine, was hardly any worse under German rule than
it had been under France, and that, because some Alsatians preferred to
belong to France rather than to Germany, and he, our guest, found it
desirable to re-establish the glory of French arms, it was not worth
while, either to begin those terrible calamities which result from war,
or even to sacrifice one single human life. In reply to his arguments
that it was all very well for us to speak thus, since we had not
experienced the same, and that we should be speaking differently, if we
had the Baltic provinces and Poland taken away from us, we said that
even from the political standpoint the loss of Poland and of the Baltic
provinces could not be a calamity for us, but might rather be considered
an advantage, since it would diminish the necessity for a military force
and the expenses of state; and from the Christian point of view we never
could permit a war, since a war demanded the killing of men, whereas
Christianity not only forbade every murder, but even demanded that we do
good to all men, considering all, without distinction of nationalities,
as our brothers. The Christian state, we said, which enters upon war, to
be consistent, must not only haul down the crosses from the churches,
turn all the churches into buildings for different purposes, give the
clergy other offices, and, above all, prohibit the Gospel, but must also
renounce all the demands of morality which result from the Christian
law. “<em>C’est à prendre ou à laisser</em>,” we said. But until
Christianity was abolished, it would be possible to entice men to war
only by cunning and deceit, as indeed is being done nowadays. We see
this cunning and deception, and so cannot submit to it. As there was no
music, no champagne, nothing intoxicating about us, our guest only
shrugged his shoulders and with customary French amiability remarked
that he was very thankful for the fine reception accorded to him in our
house, but that he was sorry that his ideas were not treated in the same
way.</p>

<section id="ix" class="level1">
<h1>IX</h1>
<p>After this conversation we went to the mowing, and there he, in the
hope of finding more sympathy for his ideas among the masses, asked me
to translate to the peasant Prokófi, an old, sickly man, with an
enormous rupture, who none the less stuck to his work, and was my
companion in the mowing, his plan of attacking the Germans, which was to
squeeze the Germans, who were between the French and the Russians, from
both sides. The Frenchman gave an ocular demonstration of this to
Prokófi, by touching from two sides Prokófi’s sweaty hempen shirt with
his white fingers. I recall Prokófi’s good-naturedly scornful surprise,
when I explained to him the Frenchman’s words and gestures. The
proposition to squeeze the Germans from both sides was apparently taken
by Prokófi as a joke, for he would not admit the idea that a grown man
and a scholar should calmly and when he was sober talk of the
desirability of war.</p>
<p>“Well, if we squeeze the German from both sides,” he replied
jestingly to what he thought was a joke, “he will have no place to go
to. We must give him room.”</p>
<p>I translated this to my guest.</p>
<p>“<em>Dites lui que nous aimons les Russes</em>,” he said.</p>
<p>These words obviously startled Prokofi even more than the proposition
to squeeze the German, and provoked a certain sentiment of
suspicion.</p>
<p>“Who is he?” Prokófi asked me, with mistrust, indicating my guest
with his head.</p>
<p>I told him that he was a Frenchman, a rich man.</p>
<p>“What is his business?” Prokófi asked me.</p>
<p>When I explained to him that he had come to invite the Russians to
form an alliance with France in case of a war with Germany, Prokófi
apparently became quite dissatisfied, and, turning to the women, who
were sitting near a haycock, he shouted at them in a strong voice, which
involuntarily betrayed the feelings which this conversation had provoked
in him, that they should go and rake up the unraked hay.</p>
<p>“Come now, you crows! Have you fallen asleep? Come! Much time we have
to squeeze the German! We have not finished the mowing yet, and it looks
likely that we shall be mowing on Wednesday,” he said. And then, as
though fearing to offend the stranger by such a remark, he added,
displaying his half-worn-off teeth in a good-natured smile, “You had
better come and work with us, and send the German, too. When we get
through working, we shall have a good time. We’ll take the German along.
They are just such folk as we.”, And, having said tins, Prokofi took his
muscular arm out of the crotch of the fork, on which he had been
leaning, threw the fork over his shoulders, and went away to the
women.</p>
<p>“<em>Oh, le brave homme!</em>” the polite Frenchman exclaimed,
smiling. And with this he then concluded his diplomatic mission to the
Russian people.</p>
<p>The sight of these so radically different men,—the one beaming with
freshness, alacrity, elegance, the well-fed Frenchman, in a silk hat and
long overcoat of the latest fashion, energetically illustrating with his
white hands, unused to labour, how to squeeze the Germans, and the sight
of the dishevelled Prokofi, with hay-seed in his hair, dried up from
work, sunburnt, always tired and always working, in spite of his immense
rupture, with fingers swollen from work, with his loosely hanging
homespun trousers, battered bast shoes, jogging along with an immense
forkful of hay over his shoulder in that indolent pace of a labouring
man, which economizes motion,—the sight of these two so radically
different men elucidated to me then many things, and has occurred to me
now, after the Toulon-Paris celebrations. One of them personified all
those men, nurtured by the labours of the masses, who later use these
masses as food for cannon; and Prokófi personified to me that food for
cannon, which nurtures and makes secure the men who dispose of it.</p>

<p>“But France has been deprived of two provinces,—two children have
been violently removed from their mother. But Russia cannot permit
Germany to prescribe laws to it and to deprive it of its historic
destiny in the East,—it cannot tolerate the chance of having its
provinces, the Baltic provinces, Poland, the Caucasus, taken from it, as
was done in the case of France. But Germany cannot tolerate the
possibility of losing its prerogatives, which it has gained through so
many sacrifices. But England cannot yield its supremacy on the seas to
any one.” And, having spoken such words, it is generally assumed that a
Frenchman, a Russian, a German, an Englishman must be prepared to
sacrifice everything in order to regain the lost provinces, to establish
their predominance in the East, to maintain their unity and power, their
supremacy on the seas, and so forth.</p>
<p>It is assumed that the sentiment of patriotism is, in the first
place, a sentiment which is always inherent in men, and, in the second,
such an exalted moral sentiment that, if it is absent, it has to be
evoked in those who do not have it. But neither is correct. I have
passed half a century among the Russian masses, and among the great
majority of the real Russian people I have in all that time never seen
or heard even once any manifestation or expression of this sentiment of
patriotism, if we do not count those patriotic phrases, which are
learned by rote during military service or are repeated from books by
the most frivolous and spoiled men of the nation. I have never heard any
expression of patriotic sentiments from the people; but, I have, on the
contrary, frequently heard the most serious and respectable men from
among the masses giving utterance to the most absolute indifference and
even contempt for all kinds of manifestations of patriotism. The same
thing I have observed among the labouring classes of other nations, and
I have often been assured of the same by cultured Frenchmen, Germans,
and Englishmen concerning their own working people.</p>
<p>The working people are too busy with the all-absorbing business of
supporting themselves and their families, to be interested in those
political questions, which present themselves as the chief motive of
patriotism,—the questions of Prussia’s influence in the East, the unity
of Germany, or the restitution of the lost provinces to France, or the
acts of this or that part of one state toward another, and so forth, do
not interest them, not only because they hardly ever know the conditions
under which these questions have arisen, but also because the interests
of their lives are quite independent of the political interests. It is
always very much a matter of indifference to a man from the masses,
where certain borders will be marked down, or to whom Constantinople
will belong, or whether Saxony or Brunswick will be a member of the
German union, or whether Australia or Matabeleland will belong to
England, or even to what government he will have to pay taxes and to
what army he will have to send his sons; but it is always very important
for him to know how much he will have to pay in taxes, how long he has
to serve, and how much he will receive for his labour,—and these are
questions that are quite independent of the common political interests.
It is for this reason that, in spite of all the intensified means used
by the governments for the inoculation of the masses with a patriotism
which is alien to them and for the suppression of the ideas of
socialism, which are developing among them, the socialism more and more
penetrates into the masses, and the patriotism, which is so carefully
inoculated by the governments, is not only not adopted by the masses,
but is disappearing more and more, maintaining itself only among the
upper classes, to whom it is advantageous. If it happens that at times
patriotism takes hold of the popular crowd, as was the case in Paris,
this is only so when the masses are subjected to an intensified hypnotic
influence by the governments and the ruling classes, and the patriotism
is maintained among the masses only so long at this influence lasts.</p>
<p>Thus, for example, in Russia, where patriotism, in the form of love
and loyalty for the faith, the Tsar, and the country, is inoculated in
the masses with extraordinary tension and with the use of all the tools
at the command of the governments, such as the church, the school, the
press, and all kinds of solemnities, the Russian labouring classes,—one
hundred millions of the Russian nation,—in spite of Russia’s unearned
reputation as a nation that is particularly devoted to its faith, its
Tsar, and its country, are most free from the deception of patriotism
and from loyalty to faith, the Tsar, and country. The men of the masses
for the most part do not know their Orthodox, state faith, to which they
are supposed to be so loyal, and when they come to know it, they
immediately give it up and become rationalists, that is, accept a faith
which it is impossible to attack or to defend; on their Tsar they, in
spite of the constant and persistent influences brought to bear upon
them, look as upon all the powers of violence, if not with condemnation,
at least with absolute indifference; but their country, if by that we do
not mean their village or township, they do not know at all, or, if they
do, they do not distinguish it from any other countries, so that, as
Russian colonists used to go to Austria and to Turkey, they now with
just as much indifference settle in Russia, outside of Russia, in Turkey
or in China.</p>

<p>My old friend D—, who in the winter lived alone in</p>
<p>the country, while his wife, whom he went to see but rarely, lived in
Paris, used to talk during the long autumn evenings with an illiterate,
but very clever and respectable peasant, an elder, who came in the
evening to report, and my friend told him, among other things, of the
superiority of the French political order over our own. This was on the
eve of the last Polish insurrection and the interference of the French
government in our affairs. The patriotic Russian newspapers at that time
burned with indignation on account of such interference, and so heated
up the ruling classes that they talked of a war with France.</p>
<p>My friend, who had read the papers, told the elder also of these
relations between Russia and France. Submitting to the tone of the
papers, my friend said that if there should be any war (he was an old
soldier), he would serve and fight against France. At that time the
“<em>revanche</em>” against the French seemed necessary to the Russians
on account of Sevastopol.</p>
<p>“But why should we wage war?” asked the elder.</p>
<p>“How can we permit France to manage our affairs?”</p>
<p>“But you say yourself that things are better arranged with them than
with us,” the elder said, quite seriously. “Let them arrange matters in
our country, too.”</p>
<p>My friend told me that this reflection so startled him that he was
absolutely at a loss what to say, and only laughed, as laugh those who
awaken from a deceptive dream.</p>
<p>Such reflections one may hear from any sober Russian labouring man,
if only he is not under any hypnotic influence of the government. They
talk of the love of the Russian masses for their faith, their Tsar, and
their government, and yet there will not be found one commune of
peasants in the whole of Russia, which would hesitate for a moment,
which of the two places to choose for its colonization,—Russia, with the
Tsar, the little father, as they write in books, and with the holy
Orthodox faith in its adored country, but with less and worse land, or
without the little father, the white Tsar, and without the Orthodox
faith, somewhere outside of Russia, in Prussia, China, Turkey, Austria,
but with some greater and better advantages, as indeed we have seen
before and see at present. For every Russian peasant the question as to
what government he will be under (since he knows that, no matter under
what government he may be, he will be fleeced just the same) has
incomparably less meaning than the question as to whether, I will not
say the water is good, but as to whether the clay is soft and as to
whether there will be a good crop of cabbage.</p>
<p>But it may be thought that the indifference of the Russians is due to
this, that any other government under whose power they may come will
certainly be better than the Russian, because in Europe there is not one
that is worse than the Russian; but that is not so: so far as I know, we
have seen the same in the case of the English, Dutch, German immigrants
in America, and of all the other colonists in Russia.</p>
<p>The transference of the European nations from the power of one
government to another, from the Turkish to the Austrian, or from the
French to the German, changes the condition of the nations so little
that in no case can they provoke the dissatisfaction of the working
classes, so long as they are not artificially subjected to the
suggestions of the governments and the ruling classes.</p>
</section>
<section id="xii" class="level1">
<h1>XII</h1>
<p>People generally adduce, in proof of the existence of patriotism, the
manifestations of patriotic sentiments in a nation during a time of all
kinds of celebrations, as, for example, in Russia during a coronation or
the meeting of the emperor after the calamity of the seventeenth of
October, or in France during the proclamation of war against Prussia, or
in Germany during the festivities of victory, or during the
Franco-Russian celebrations.</p>
<p>But it ought to be known how these manifestations are prepared. In
Russia, for example, people are especially dressed up by the village
commune and the owners of factories to meet and welcome the emperor
whenever he passes through a given locality.</p>
<p>The transports of the masses are generally prepared artificially by
those who need them, and the degree of transport expressed by the crowd
shows only the degree of the art of the arrangers of these transports.
This business has long been practised, and so the specialists in
arranging such transports have reached a high degree of virtuosity in
these arrangements. When Alexander II was still an heir apparent, and
was in command, as is usually the case, of the Preobrázhenski regiment,
he once drove out after dinner to the regiment in camp. The moment his
carriage appeared, the soldiers, coatless as they were, rushed out to
meet him, and with such transport welcomed, as they say, their most
august commander, that all ran a race behind his carriage, and many of
them made the sign of the cross while on a run, looking all the time at
the heir apparent. All those who saw this meeting were deeply touched by
this naive loyalty and love of the Russian soldiers for their Tsar and
his heir, and by that sincere religious and apparently unprepared
transport which was expressed in the faces, the motions, and especially
in the signs of the cross, which the soldiers made. However, all that
was done artificially and prepared in the following manner: after the
inspection of the previous day the heir said to the brigade commander
that he would drive up the next day to the regiment.</p>
<p>“When are we to expect your Imperial Majesty?”</p>
<p>“In all probability in the evening. Only, please, no
preparations.”</p>
<p>The moment the heir drove off, the brigade commander called together
the commanders of the companies and gave the order that on the following
day all the soldiers were to appear in clean shirts, and, as soon as
they saw the heir’s carriage, which the signallers were to announce,
they were to run at haphazard after the carriage, shouting “Hurrah!” and
that, at the same time, every tenth man in the company was to run and
make the sign of the cross. The sergeants drew up the companies, and,
counting the soldiers, stopped at every tenth man: “One, two, three…
eight, nine, ten,—Sidorénko—the sign of the cross; one, two, three,
four… Ivánov—the sign of the cross…” Everything was carried out as by
command, and the impression of transport was complete, both on the heir
apparent and on all the persons present, even on the soldiers and the
officers, and even on the commander of the brigade, who had invented all
that. Just so, though less coarsely, they do in all places, wherever
there are any patriotic manifestations. Thus the Franco-Russian
celebrations, which present themselves to us as free expressions of the
people’s sentiments, did not originate with the people, but were, on the
contrary, very artfully and quite obviously prepared and provoked by the
French government.</p>
<p>“The moment the arrival of the Russian sailors became known,” I am
again quoting the same <em>Rural Messenger</em>, the official organ,
which collects its information from all the other newspapers,
“committees for the arrangement of celebrations were being formed, not
only in all the large and small cities lying on the route from Toulon to
Paris, a considerable distance, but also in a large number of towns and
villages which lie quite to either side of this route. Everywhere a
subscription was opened for contributions to meet the expenses for these
celebrations. Many cities sent deputations to Paris to our imperial
ambassador, imploring him to let the sailors visit their cities even for
one day or even for one hour. The municipal governments of all those
cities in which our sailors were ordered to stay set aside vast sums,
averaging more than one hundred thousand roubles, for the arrangement of
all kinds of festivities and amusements, and expressed their willingness
to expend even greater sums, as much as should be needed, provided the
welcome and the celebrations should be as magnificent as possible.</p>
<p>“In Paris itself a private committee collected, in addition to the
sum set aside by the city government for this purpose, an immense sum by
private subscription, also for the arrangement of amusements, and the
French government assigned more than one hundred thousand roubles for
expenses incurred by the ministers and other authorities in welcoming
the guests. In many cities, where our sailors will not set foot at all,
they none the less decided to celebrate the first of October with all
kinds of festivities in honour of Russia. A vast number of cities and
provinces decided to send special deputations to Toulon and Paris, in
order to welcome the Russian guests and to offer them presents to
remember France by, or to send to them addresses and telegrams of
welcome. It was decided everywhere to consider the first of October a
national holiday and to dismiss the pupils of all the educational
institutions for that day, and in Paris for two days. Officials of lower
rank had their penalties remitted, that they might, gratefully remember
the joyful day for France,—the first of October.</p>
<p>“To make it easier for those who wished to visit Toulon and take part
in the welcome to the Russian squadron, the railways lowered the rates
to one-half and sent out special trains.”</p>
<p>And thus, when by means of a whole series of universal, simultaneous
measures, which the government can always take by dint of the power
which it has in its hands, a certain part of the nation, pre-eminently
the scum of the people, the city crowd, is brought to a condition of
abnormal excitement, they say: “Behold, this is the free expression of
the will of the whole nation.” Manifestations like those which just took
place in Toulon and in Paris, which in Germany take place at the meeting
of the emperor or of Bismarck, or at manoeuvres in Lorraine, and which
are constantly repeated in Russia at every meeting circumstanced with
solemnity, prove only this, that the means of an artificial excitation
of the people, which now are in the hands of the governments and the
ruling classes, are so powerful that the governments and the ruling
classes, which are in possession of them, are always able at will to
provoke any kind of a patriotic manifestation they may wish by rousing
the patriotic sentiments of the masses. Nothing, on the contrary, proves
the absence of patriotism in the masses with such obviousness as those
tense efforts which now are made by the governments and the ruling
classes for the artificial excitation of patriotism, and the
insignificant results which are obtained in spite of all the
efforts.</p>
<p>If patriotic sentiments are so proper to the nations, they should be
permitted to manifest themselves freely, and should not be provoked by
all kinds of exclusive and artificial means, applied on every possible
occasion. Let them even for a time, for one year, stop in Russia
compelling all the people, as they are doing now, upon the accession of
every Tsar, to swear allegiance to him; let them at every divine service
stop solemnly repeating several times the customary prayers for the
Tsar; let them stop celebrating his birthdays and name-days with ringing
of bells, illumination, and the prohibition to work; let them stop
everywhere hanging out and displaying representations of him; let them
stop, in prayer-books, almanacs, text-books, printing his name and the
names of his family, and even the pronouns referring to him, in
capitals; let them stop glorifying him in special books and newspapers
printed for the purpose; let them stop imprisoning men for the slightest
disrespectful word uttered concerning the Tsar,—let them stop doing all
that for a time only, and then we should see how proper it is for the
masses, for the real labouring masses, for Prokofi, for elder Ivan, and
for all the men of the Russian masses,—as the nation is made to believe
and as all the foreigners are convinced of it,—to worship the Tsar, who
in one way or another turns them over into the hands of a landed
proprietor or of the rich in general. So it is in Russia; but let them
similarly stop in Germany, France, Italy, England, America doing all
that which is done there with the same tension by the ruling classes in
order to rouse patriotism and loyalty and submission to the existing
government, and we should see in how far this imaginary patriotism is
characteristic of the nations of our time.</p>
<p>But, as it is, the masses are stultified from childhood by all
possible means, by school-books, divine services, sermons, books,
newspapers, verses, monuments, which all tend in one and the same
direction; then they select by force or bribery a few thousands of the
people, and when these assembled thousands, joined by all the loafers
who are always happy to be present at any spectacle, to the sounds of
cannon-shots and of music, and at the sight of every kind of splendour
and light begin to shout what the leaders shout to them, we are told
that this is an expression of the sentiments of the whole nation. But,
in the first place, these thousands, or, if it is a great crowd, these
tens of thousands, who shout something at such celebrations, form but a
tiny, a ten-thousandth part of the whole nation; in the second place,
out of these tens of thousands of shouting men, who wave their hats, the
greater part are either collected by force, as is the case with us in
Russia, or artificially provoked by some enticement; in the third place,
among all these thousands, there are scarcely tens who know what it is
all about, and all the rest would as gladly shout and wave their hats if
the very opposite took place; and, in the fourth place, the police are
always present, and they will make any one shut up if he does not shout
what the government wants and demands shall be shouted, and lock him up
at once, as was done with much force during the Franco-Russian
festivities.</p>
<p>In France they welcomed with equal enthusiasm the war with Russia
under Napoleon I, and then Alexander I, against whom the war was waged,
and then again Napoleon, and again the allies, and Bourbon, and Orleans,
and the Republic, and Napoleon III, and Boulanger; and in Russia they
acclaim with the same enthusiasm, to-day Peter, to-morrow Catherine, the
next day Paul, Alexander, Constantine, Nicholas, the Duke of
Lichtenberg, the brother Slavs, the King of Prussia, the French sailors,
and all those whom the government wants them to welcome. The same
happens in England, America, Germany, Italy.</p>
<p>What in our time is called patriotism is, on the one hand, only a
certain mood, which is constantly produced and maintained in the masses
by the schools, the religion, the venal press, having such a tendency as
the government demands, and, on the other, a temporary excitation,
produced with exclusive means by the ruling classes, in the masses, who
stand on a lower moral and even mental plane,—an excitation, which later
is given out as a constant expression of the will of the whole nation.
The patriotism of the oppressed nationalities does not form an exception
to this. It is as little characteristic of the working classes, and is
artificially inculcated upon them by the upper classes.</p>
</section>
<section id="xiii" class="level1">
<h1>XIII</h1>
<p>“But if the men of the masses do not experience the sentiment of
patriotism, this is due to the fact that they have not yet reached that
exalted sentiment, which is characteristic of every cultured man. If
they do not experience this exalted sentiment, it has to be educated in
them. It is this that the government is doing.”</p>
<p>Thus generally speak the men of the ruling classes, with such full
confidence that patriotism is an exalted sentiment, that the naive men
of the masses, who do not experience it, consider themselves at fault,
because they do not experience this sentiment, and try to assure
themselves that they experience it, or at least pretend that they
do.</p>
<p>But what is this exalted sentiment, which, in the opinion of the
ruling classes, ought to be educated in the nations?</p>
<p>This sentiment is in its most precise definition nothing but a
preference shown to one’s own state or nation in comparison with any
other state or nation, a sentiment which is fully expressed in the
German patriotic song, “<em>Deutschland, Deutschland über alles</em>,”
in which we need only substitute <em>Russland</em>, <em>Frankreich</em>,
<em>Italien</em>, or any other state for Deutschland, and we shall get
the clearest formula of the exalted sentiment of patriotism. It may be
that this sentiment is very desirable and useful for the governments and
the integrity of the state, but one cannot help but observe that this
sentiment is not at all exalted, but, on the contrary, very stupid and
very immoral: stupid, because, if every state will consider itself
better than any other, it is obvious that they will all be in the wrong;
and immoral, because it inevitably leads every man who experiences the
feeling to try to obtain advantages for his own state and nation, at the
expense of other states and nations—a tendency which is directly opposed
to the fundamental moral law recognized by all men: not to do unto
another what we do not wish to have done to ourselves.</p>
<p>Patriotism may have been a virtue in the ancient world, when it
demanded of man that he serve the highest ideal accessible to him at the
time,—the ideal of his country. But how can patriotism be a virtue in
our time, when it demands of men what is directly opposed to what forms
the ideal of our religion and morality,—not the recognition of the
equality and brotherhood of all men, but the recognition of one state
and nationality as predominating over all the others. This sentiment is
in our time not only not a virtue, but unquestionably a vice; no such
sentiment of patriotism in its true sense does or can exist in our time,
because the material and moral foundations for it are lacking.</p>
<p>Patriotism could have some sense in the ancient world, when every
nation, more or less homogeneous in its structure, professing one and
the same state religion, and submitting to the same unlimited power of
its supreme, deified ruler, appeared to itself as an island in the ocean
of the barbarians, which ever threatened to inundate it.</p>
<p>We can see how with such a state of affairs, patriotism, that is, the
desire to ward off the attacks of the barbarians, who were not only
prepared to destroy the social order, but who also threatened wholesale
plundering and murder, with the enslavement of men and the rape of
women, was a natural feeling, and we can see why a man, to free himself
and his compatriots from such calamities, could have preferred his
nation to all the others, and could experience a hostile feeling toward
the barbarians around him, and could kill them, in order to protect his
nation.</p>
<p>But what significance can this sentiment have in our Christian time?
On what ground and for what purpose can a man of our time, a Russian, go
and kill Frenchmen or Germans, or a Frenchman Germans, when he knows
full well, no matter how little educated he may be, that the men of the
other state and nation, against which they are rousing his patriotic
hostility, are not barbarians, but just such Christians as he,
frequently of the same faith and profession with him, desiring like him
nothing but peace and a peaceful exchange of labour, and that, besides,
they are for the most part united with him either by the interests of
common labour, or by commercial or spiritual interests, or by all
together? Thus frequently the men of another country are nearer and more
indispensable to a man than his own countrymen, as is the case with
labourers who are connected with employers of other nationalities, and
as is the case with commercial people, and especially with scholars and
artists.</p>
<p>Besides, the conditions of life themselves have so changed now that
what we call our country, what we are supposed to distinguish from
everything else, has ceased to be something clearly defined, as it was
with the ancients, where the men forming one country belonged to one
nationality, one state, and one faith. We can understand the patriotism
of an Egyptian, a Jew, a Greek, who, defending his country, was at the
same time defending his faith, and his nationality, and his home, and
his state.</p>
<p>But in what way will in our time be expressed the patriotism of an
Irishman in the United States, who by his faith belongs to Rome, by his
nationality to Ireland, by his state allegiance to the United States? In
the same condition are a Bohemian in Austria, a Pole in Russia, Prussia,
and Austria, a Hindu in England, a Tartar and an Armenian in Russia and
in Turkey. But, even leaving out these men of the separate conquered
nationalities, the men of the most homogeneous states, such as are
Russia, France, Prussia, can no longer experience that sentiment of
patriotism, which was peculiar to the ancients, because frequently all
the chief interests of their life (sometimes their domestic ones,—they
are married to women of another nation; the economic ones,—their capital
is abroad; their spiritual, scientific, or artistic ones) are not in
their own country, but outside it, in that state against which the
government is rousing his patriotic hatred.</p>
<p>But most of all is patriotism impossible in our time, because, no
matter how much we have tried for eighteen hundred years to conceal the
meaning of Christianity, it has none the less trickled through into our
life, and is guiding it in such a way that the coarsest and most stupid
of men cannot help but see the absolute incompatibility of patriotism
with those moral rules by which they live.</p>
</section>
<section id="xiv" class="level1">
<h1>XIV</h1>
<p>Patriotism was necessary for the formation, out of heterogeneous
nationalities, of strong, united kingdoms, protected against the
barbarians. But as soon as the Christian enlightenment transformed all
these kingdoms alike from within, by giving them the same foundations,
patriotism not only became unnecessary, but was also the one barrier
against that union of the nations for which they are prepared by dint of
their Christian consciousness.</p>
<p>Patriotism is in our time the cruel tradition of a long-gone-by
period of time, which holds itself only through inertia and because the
governments and the ruling classes feel that with this patriotism is
connected not only their power, but also their existence, and so with
care and cunning and violence rouse and sustain it in the nations.
Patriotism is in our time like the scaffolding, which at one time was
necessary for the construction of the walls of a building, but which
now, though it only interferes with the proper use of the building, is
not taken down, because its existence is advantageous for some
persons.</p>
<p>Among the Christian nations there has for a long time ceased to exist
any cause for discord, and there can be no such cause. It is even
impossible to imagine why and how Russian and German labourers, who
peacefully work together near the border and in the capital cities,
should begin to quarrel among themselves. And much less can we imagine
any hostility between, let us say, a Kazan peasant, who supplies a
German with corn, and the German, who supplies him with scythes and
machines, and similarly among French, German, and Italian labourers. It
is even ridiculous to talk of quarrels among the scholars, artists,
writers of various nationalities, who live by the same interests, that
are independent of nationality and the state structure.</p>
<p>But the governments cannot leave the nations alone, that is, in
peaceful relations among themselves, because the chief, if not the only
justification of the existence of the governments consists in making
peace between the nations, that is, in allaying their hostile relations.
And so the governments provoke these hostile relations under the guise
of patriotism, and then make it appear that they are making peace among
the nations. It is something like what a gipsy does, who pours some
pepper under his horse’s tail, and lashes it in the stall, and then
leads it out, while hanging on to the bridle, pretending that he has the
hardest time to restrain the mettled horse.</p>
<p>We are assured that the governments are concerned about preserving
the peace among the nations. In what way do they preserve this
peace?</p>
<p>People are living along the Rhine in peaceful intercourse among
themselves,—suddenly, in consequence of all kinds of disputes and
intrigues between the kings and emperors, war breaks out, and the French
government finds it necessary to recognize some of these inhabitants as
Frenchmen. Ages pass, men have become accustomed to this state of
affairs; again there begin hostilities between the governments of the
great nations, and war breaks out on the slightest pretence, and the
Germans find it necessary to recognize these inhabitants once more as
Germans, and in all the French and the Germans ill-will flames up toward
one another. Or Germans and Russians are living peacefully near the
border, peacefully exchanging their labour and the products of labour,
and suddenly the same institutions which exist only in the name of the
pacification of the nations begin to quarrel, to do one foolish thing
after another, and are not able to invent anything better than the
coarsest childish method of self-inflicted punishment, if only they can
thus have their will and do something nasty to their adversary (which in
this case is especially advantageous, since not those who start a
customs war, but others, suffer from it); thus the Customs War between
Russia and Germany was lately started. Then, with the aid of the
newspapers, there flames up a malevolent feeling, which is still farther
fanned by the Franco-Russian celebrations, and which, before we know it,
may lead to a sanguinary war.</p>
<p>I have cited the last two examples of the manner in which the
governments affect the people by rousing in them a hostile feeling
toward other nations, because they are contemporary; but there is not
one war in all history, which was not provoked by the governments, by
the governments alone, independently of the advantages to the nations,
to which war, even if it is successful, is always harmful.</p>
<p>The governments assure the nations that they are in danger of an
incursion from other nations and from internal enemies, and that the
only salvation from this danger consists in the slavish obedience of the
nations to their governments. This is most obvious in the time of
revolutions and dictatorships, and this takes place at all times and in
all places, wherever there is power. Every government explains its
existence and justifies all its violence by insisting that, if it did
not exist, things would be worse. By assuring the nations that they are
in danger, the governments subject them to themselves. When the nations
submit to the governments, these governments compel these nations to
attack the other nations. In this manner the nations find confirmed the
assurances of their governments in regard to the danger from being
attacked by other nations.</p>
<p><em>Divide et impera</em>.</p>
<p>Patriotism in its simplest, clearest, and most unquestionable
significance is for the rulers nothing but a tool for attaining their
ambitious and selfish ends, and for the ruled a renunciation of human
dignity, reason, conscience, and a slavish submission to those who are
in power. Thus is patriotism actually preached, wherever it is
preached.</p>
<p>Patriotism is slavery.</p>
<p>The advocates of peace through arbitration judge like this: two
animals cannot divide their prey otherwise than by fighting, as do
children, barbarians, and barbarous nations. But sensible people settle
their differences by discussion, conviction, the transmission of the
solution of the question to disinterested, sensible men. Even thus must
the sensible nations of our time act. These reflections seem quite
correct. The nations of our time have reached an age of discretion, are
not hostile to one another, and should be able to settle their
differences in a peaceable manner. But the reflection is correct only in
reference to the nations, to the nations alone, if they were not under
the power of their governments. But the nations which submit to their
governments cannot be sensible, because submission to the governments is
already a sign of the greatest senselessness.</p>
<p>How can we talk of the sensibleness of men who promise in advance to
do everything (including the murder of men) which the government, that
is, certain men who have accidentally come to hold this position, may
command them to do?</p>
<p>Men who are able to accept such a duty of unflinching submission to
what certain strangers will, from St. Petersburg, Vienna, Paris, command
them to do, cannot be sensible, and the governments, that is, the men
who possess such power, can still less be sensible, and cannot help
abusing it,—they cannot help losing their minds from such a senselessly
terrible power. For that reason the peace among the nations cannot be
attained by any sensible means, through conventions, through
arbitrations, so long as there exists a submission to the governments,
which is always senseless and always pernicious.</p>
<p>But the submission of men to the governments will always exist, so
long as there is any patriotism, because every power is based on
patriotism, that is, on the readiness of men, for the sake of defending
their nation, their country, that is, the state, against supposed
dangers that are threatening it, to submit to the power.</p>
<p>On this patriotism was based the power of the French kings over the
whole nation previous to the Revolution; on the same patriotism was
based the power of the Committee of Public Safety after the Revolution;
on the same patriotism was reared the power of Napoleon (as consul and
as emperor); and on the same patriotism, after the downfall of Napoleon,
was established the power of the Bourbons, and later of the Republic,
and of Louis Philippe, and again of the Republic, and again of
Bonaparte, and again of the Republic, and on the same patriotism came
very near being established the power of Mr. Boulanger.</p>
<p>It is terrible to say so, but there does not exist, and there has not
existed, a case of aggregate violence committed by one set of men
against another which has not been committed in the name of patriotism.
In the name of patriotism the Russians fought with the French, and the
French with the Russians, and in the name of patriotism the Russians and
the French are now preparing themselves to wage war against the
Germans,—to fight from two flanks. But war is not all,—in the name of
patriotism the Russians crush the Poles, and the Germans the Slavs; in
the name of patriotism the Communists killed the Versaillians, and the
Versaillians, the Communists.</p>

<p>It would seem that with the dissemination of culture, of improved
means of locomotion, of frequent intercourse among the men of the
various nations, in connection with the diffusion of the press, and,
above all, in connection with the complete absence of danger from other
nations, the deception of patriotism ought to become harder and harder,
and ought in the end to become impossible.</p>
<p>But the point is, that these same means of a universal external
culture, of improved methods of locomotion, and of intercommunication,
and above all, of the press, which the governments have seized upon and
seize upon more and more, give them now such a power of exciting in the
nations hostile feelings toward one another, that, though on the one
hand the obviousness of the uselessness and harm of patriotism has
increased, there has, on the other, increased the power of the
governments and of the ruling classes to influence the masses, by
rousing patriotism in them.</p>
<p>The difference between what was and what now is consists only in
this, that, since now a much greater number of men share in the
advantages which patriotism affords to the upper classes, a much greater
number of men take part in the dissemination and maintenance of this
wonderful superstition.</p>
<p>The more difficult it is to maintain the power, the greater and
greater is the number of men with whom the government shares it.</p>
<p>Formerly a small group of rulers had the power,—emperors, kings,
dukes, their officials, and warriors; but now the participants in this
power and in the advantages which it affords are not only the officials
and the clergy, but also capitalists, great and small, the landowners,
bankers, members of Chambers, teachers, rural officers, scholars, even
artists, and especially journalists. And all these persons consciously
and unconsciously spread the deception of patriotism, which is
indispensable to them for the maintenance of their advantageous
position. And the deception, thanks to the fact that the means of
deception have become more powerful and that now an ever-growing number
of men are taking part in it, is produced so successfully that, in spite
of the great difficulty of deceiving, the degree of the deception
remains the same.</p>
<p>One hundred years ago, the illiterate masses, who had no conception
as to who composed their government and as to what nations surrounded
them, blindly obeyed those local officials and gentry, whose slaves they
were. And it sufficed for the government by means of bribes and rewards
to keep these officials and this gentry in their power, in order that
the masses might obediently do what was demanded of them. But now, when
the masses for the most part can read and more or less know of whom
their government is composed, and what nations surround them; when the
men of the masses constantly move about with ease from one place to
another, bringing to the masses information about what is going on in
the world, a mere demand to carry out the commands of the government no
longer suffices: it becomes necessary to obscure the true conceptions
which the masses have concerning life, and to impress them with improper
ideas concerning the conditions of their life and concerning the
relation of other nations toward them.</p>
<p>And so, thanks to the diffusion of the press, of the rudiments, and
of the means of communication, the governments, having their agents
everywhere, by means of decrees, church sermons, the schools, the
newspapers inculcate on the masses the wildest and most perverse
conceptions about their advantages, about the relation of the peoples
among themselves, about their properties and intentions; and the masses,
which are so crushed by labour that they have no time and no chance to
understand the significance and verify the correctness of those
conceptions which are inculcated upon them, and of those demands which
are made on them in the name of their good, submit to them without a
murmur.</p>
<p>But the men from the masses who free themselves from constant labour
and who educate themselves, and who, it would seem, should be able to
understand the deception which is practised upon them, are subjected to
such an intensified effect of menaces, bribery, and hypnotization by the
governments, that they almost without an exception pass over to the side
of the governments and, accepting advantageous and well-paid positions
as teachers, priests, officers, officials, become participants in the
dissemination of the deception which ruins their fellow men. It is as
though at the door of education stood a snare, into which inevitably
fall those who in one way or another leave the masses that are absorbed
in labour.</p>
<p>At first, as one comes to understand the cruelty of the deception,
there involuntarily rises an indignation against those who for their
personal, selfish, ambitious advantage produce this cruel deception,
which destroys, not only men’s bodies, but also their souls, and one
feels like showing up these cruel deceivers. But the point is, that the
deceivers do not deceive because they want to deceive, but because they
almost cannot do otherwise. And they do not deceive in any Machiavellian
way, with a consciousness of the deception which they practise, but for
the most part with the naive assurance that they are doing something
good and elevated, in which opinion they are constantly maintained by
the sympathy and approval of all the men who surround them. It is true
that, feeling dimly that their power and their advantageous position is
based on this deception, they are involuntarily drawn toward it; but
they do not act because they wish to deceive the masses, but because
they think that the work which they are doing is useful for the
masses.</p>
<p>Thus emperors and kings and their ministers, performing their
coronations, manoeuvres, inspections, mutual visits, during which time
they, dressing themselves up in all kinds of uniforms and travelling
from one place to another, consult with one another with serious faces
about how to pacify presumably hostile nations (who will never think of
fighting with one another), are absolutely convinced that everything
they do is exceedingly sensible and useful.</p>
<p>Similarly all the ministers, diplomatists, and all kinds of
officials, who dress themselves up in their uniforms, with all kinds of
ribbons and little crosses, and with preoccupation write on fine paper
their obscure, twisted, useless numbered reports, communications,
prescriptions, projects, are absolutely convinced that without this
their activity the whole life of the nations will come to a standstill
or will be entirely destroyed.</p>
<p>Similarly the military, who dress themselves up in their ridiculous
costumes and who seriously discuss with what guns or cannon it is better
to kill people, are fully convinced that their manoeuvres and parades
are most important and necessary for the nation.</p>
<p>The same conviction is held by the preachers, journalists, and
writers of patriotic verses and text-books, who receive a liberal reward
for preaching patriotism. Nor is any doubt concerning this harboured by
the managers of celebrations, like the Franco-Russian ones, who are
sincerely affected when they utter their patriotic speeches and toasts.
All people do unconsciously what they do, because that is necessary, or
because their whole life is based on this deception and they are unable
to do anything else, while these same acts evoke the sympathy and the
approval of all those men among whom they are committed. Not only do
they, being all connected with one another, approve and justify the acts
and the activities of one another,—the emperors and kings, the acts of
the soldiers, the officials, and the clergy; and the military, the
officials, and the clergy, the acts of the emperors, the kings, and one
another,—the popular crowd, especially the city crowd, which sees no
comprehensible meaning in everything which is being done by these men,
involuntarily ascribes a special, almost a supernatural significance to
them. The crowd sees, for example, that triumphal arches are being
erected; that men masquerade in crowns, uniforms, vestments; that
fireworks are displayed, cannon are fired, bells are rung, regiments are
marching with music, documents, telegrams, and couriers fly from one
place to another, and strangely masquerading men with preoccupation keep
riding from one place to another, saying and writing something, and so
forth,—and, not being able to verify whether there is the slightest need
for what is being done (as, indeed, there is none), ascribes to all this
a special, mysterious, and important meaning, and with shouts of
transport or with silent awe meets all these manifestations. But in the
meantime these expressions of transport and the constant respect of the
crowd still more strengthen the assurance of the men who are doing all
these foolish things.</p>
<p>Lately William II ordered a new throne for himself, with some special
ornaments, and, dressing himself up in a white uniform with patches, in
tight trousers, and in a helmet with a bird on it, and throwing a red
mantle over all, came out to his subjects and seated himself on this
throne, with the full assurance that this was a very necessary and
important act, and his subjects not only did not see anything funny in
all this, but even found this spectacle to be very majestic.</p>

<h1>XVI</h1>
<p>The power of the governments has now for a long time ceased to be
based on force, as it was based in those times when one nationality
conquered another and by force of arms held it in subjection, or when
the rulers, amidst a defenceless people, maintained separate armed
troops of janissaries, opríchniks, or guardsmen. The power of the
governments has now for a long time been based on what is called public
opinion.</p>
<p>There exists a public opinion that patriotism is a great moral
sentiment, and that it is good and right to consider one’s own nation,
one’s own state, the best in the world, and from this there naturally
establishes itself a public opinion that it is necessary to recognize
the power of the government over ourselves and to submit to it; that it
is good and right to serve in the army and to submit to discipline; that
it is good and right to give up our savings in the shape of taxes to the
government; that it is good and right to submit to the decisions of the
courts; that it is good and right to believe without verification in
what is given out as a divine truth by the men of the government.</p>
<p>Once such a public opinion exists, there establishes itself a mighty
power, which in our time has command of milliards of money, of an
organized mechanism of government, the post, the telegraphs, the
telephones, disciplined armies, courts, the police, a submissive clergy,
the school, even the press, and this power maintains in the nations that
public opinion which it needs.</p>
<p>The power of the governments is maintained through public opinion;
but, having the power, the governments by means of all their organs, the
officers of the courts, the school, the church, even the press, are
always able to keep up the public opinion which they need. Public
opinion produces power,—power produces public opinion. There seems to be
no way out from this situation.</p>
<p>Thus it would, indeed, be, if public opinion were something stable
and unchanging, and if the governments were able to produce the public
opinion which they need.</p>
<p>But fortunately this is not the case, and public opinion is, in the
first place, not something which is constant, unchanging, stable, but,
on the contrary, something eternally changing, moving together with the
motion of humanity; and, in the second, public opinion not only cannot
be produced by the will of the governments, but is that which produces
the governments and gives them power or takes it away from them.</p>
<p>It may appear that public opinion remains immovable and now is such
as it was decades ago, and it may appear that public opinion wavers in
relation to certain special cases, as though going back, so that, for
example, it now destroys the republic, putting the monarchy in its
place, and now again destroys the monarchy, putting the republic in its
place; but that only seems so when we view the external manifestations
of that public opinion which is artificially produced by the
governments. We need only take public opinion in its relation to the
whole life of men, and we shall see that public opinion, just like the
time of the day or year, never stands in one place, but is always in
motion, always marching unrestrictedly ahead along the path on which
humanity proceeds, just as, in spite of retardations and waverings, day
or spring moves on unrestrictedly along the path over which the sun
travels.</p>
<p>Thus, though by the external signs the condition of the nations of
Europe in our time is nearly the same that it was fifty years ago, the
relation of the nations toward it is now entirely different from what it
was fifty years ago. Though there exist, even as fifty years ago, the
same rulers, armies, wars, taxes, luxury, and misery, the same
Catholicism, Orthodoxy, Lutheranism, these existed before because the
public opinion of the nations demanded them, but now they all exist
because the governments artificially maintain that which formerly was a
living public opinion.</p>
<p>If we frequently do not notice this motion of public opinion, as we
do not notice the motion of water in the river, with the current of
which we are swimming, this is due to the fact that those imperceptible
changes of public opinion which form its motion are taking place in
ourselves.</p>
<p>The property of public opinion is that of constant and unrestricted
motion. If it seems to us that it is standing in one place, this is due
to the fact that everywhere there are people who have established an
advantageous position for themselves at a certain moment of public
opinion, and so with all their strength try to maintain it and not to
admit the manifestation of the new, the present public opinion which,
though not yet fully expressed, is living in the consciousness of men.
Such people, who retain the obsolete public opinion and conceal the new,
are all those who at the present time form the governments and the
ruling classes, and who profess patriotism as an indispensable condition
of human life.</p>
<p>The means which are at the command of these people are enormous, but
since public opinion is something eternally flowing and increasing, all
their efforts cannot help but be vain: the old grows old, and the
youthful grows.</p>
<p>The longer the expression of the new public opinion shall be
retained, the more it will grow, and the greater will be the force with
which it will express itself. The government and the ruling classes try
with all their strength to retain that old public opinion of patriotism,
on which their power is based, and to retard the manifestation of the
new, which will destroy it. But it is possible only within certain
limits to retain the old and retard the new, just as running water can
be held back by a dam only within certain limits.</p>
<p>No matter how much the governments may try to rouse in the nations
the past public opinion, now no longer characteristic of them,
concerning the dignity and virtue of patriotism, the men of our time no
longer believe in patriotism, but more and more believe in the
solidarity and brotherhood of the nations. Patriotism now presents to
men nothing but the most terrible future; but the brotherhood of the
nations forms that ideal which more and more grows to be comprehensible
and desirable for humanity. And so the transition of men from the former
obsolete public opinion to the new must inevitably be accomplished. This
transition is as inevitable as the falling of the last sere leaves in
autumn and the unfolding of the young leaves in swelling buds.</p>
<p>The longer this transition is delayed, the more imperative does it
become, and the more obvious is its necessity.</p>
<p>Indeed, we need only recall what it is we are professing, as
Christians, and simply as men of our time, we need but recall those
moral bases which guide us in our public, domestic, and private life,
and that position in which we have placed ourselves in the name of
patriotism, in order that we may see what degree of contradiction we
have reached between our consciousness and that which among us, thanks
to the intensified influence of the government in this respect, is
regarded as our public opinion.</p>
<p>We need only reflect on those very usual demands of patriotism, which
present themselves to us as something very simple and natural, in order
that we may understand to what extent these demands contradict that real
public opinion which we all share now. We all consider ourselves free,
cultured, humane men, and even Christians, and at the same time we are
in such a position that if to-morrow William takes umbrage at Alexander,
or Mr. N— writes a clever article on the Eastern question, or some
prince robs the Bulgarians or the Serbians, or some queen or empress
takes offence at something, we all, the cultured, humane Christians,
must go out to kill men, whom we do not know, and toward whom we are
friendly disposed, as toward all men. If this has not yet happened, we
owe this, as we are assured, to the peaceful mind of Alexander III, or
to this, that Nicholas Aleksándrovich is going to marry Victoria’s
grandchild. But let another man be in the place of Alexander, or let
Alexander himself change his mood, or Nicholas Aleksandrovich marry
Amalia, and not Alice, and we shall throw ourselves like bloodthirsty
animals upon one another, to take out one another’s guts. Such is the
supposed public opinion of our time. Such opinions are calmly repeated
in all the leading and liberal organs of the press.</p>
<p>If we, the Christians of one thousand years’ standing, have not yet
cut one another’s throats, it is because Alexander III does not let us
do so.</p>
<p>This is, indeed, terrible.</p>

<p>For the greatest and most important changes to take place in the life
of humanity, no exploits are needed,—neither the armament of millions of
soldiers, nor the construction of new roads and machines, nor the
establishment of exhibitions, nor the establishment of labour-unions,
nor revolutions, nor barricades, nor explosions, nor the invention of
aerial motion, and so forth, but only a change in public opinion. But
for public opinion to change, no efforts of the mind are needed, nor the
rejection of anything existing, nor the invention of anything unusual
and new; all that is needed is, that every separate man should say what
he actually thinks and feels, or at least should not say what he does
not think. Let men, even a small number of them, do so, and the obsolete
public opinion will fall of its own accord and there will be manifested
the youthful, live, present public opinion. And let public opinion
change, and the inner structure of men’s life, which torments and pains
them, will be changed without any effort. It is really a shame to think
how little is needed for all men to be freed from all those calamities
which now oppress them; they need only stop lying. Let men only not
succumb to that lie which is inculcated on them, let them not say what
they do not think or feel, and immediately a revolution will take place
in the whole structure of our life, such as the revolutionists will not
accomplish in centuries, even if all the power were in their hands.</p>
<p>If men only believed that the strength is not in strength, but in the
truth, and if they boldly expressed it, or at least did not depart from
it in words and deeds,—if they did not say what they do not think, and
did not do what they consider bad and stupid.</p>
<p>“What harm is there in crying ‘<em>Vive la France!</em>’ or ‘Hurrah!’
to some emperor, king, victor, or in going in a uniform, with the
chamberlain’s key, to wait for him in the antechamber, to bow, and to
address him by strange titles, and then to impress all young and
uncultured men with the fact that this is very praiseworthy?” Or,“What
harm is there in writing an article in defence of the Franco-Russian
alliance or the Customs War, or in condemnation of the Germans,
Russians, Frenchmen, Englishmen?” Or, “What harm is there in attending
some patriotic celebration and eulogizing men whom you do not care for
and have nothing to do with, and drinking their health?” Or even, “What
harm is there in recognizing, in a conversation, the benefit and
usefulness of treaties, or alliances, or even in keeping silent, when
your nation and state is praised in your presence, and other
nationalities are cursed and blackened, or when Catholicism, Orthodoxy,
Lutheranism are praised, or when some war hero or ruler, like Napoleon,
Peter, or the contemporary Boulanger or Skóbelev, are praised?”</p>
<p>All that seems so unimportant, and yet in these seemingly unimportant
acts, in our aloofness from them, in our readiness to point out,
according to our strength, the irrationality of what is obviously
irrational,—in this does our great, invincible power consist, the power
which composes that insuperable force which forms the real, actual,
public opinion, which, moving itself, moves the whole of humanity. The
governments know this, and tremble before this force, and with all the
means at their command try to counteract it and to get possession of
it.</p>
<p>They know that the force is not in force, but in thought and in its
clear enunciation, and so they are more afraid of the expression of
independent thought than of armies, and establish censorships, bribe
newspapers, take possession of the management of religion and of
schools. But the spiritual force which moves the world slips away from
them: it is not even in a book, a newspaper,—it is intangible and always
free,—it is in the depth of men’s consciousness. The most powerful,
intangible, freest force is the one which is manifested in man’s soul,
when he by himself reflects on the phenomena of the world, and then
involuntarily expresses his thoughts to his wife, brother, friend, to
all those men with whom he comes together, and from whom he considers it
a sin to conceal what he regards as the truth. No milliards of roubles,
millions of soldiers, no institutions, nor wars, nor revolutions will
produce what will be produced by the simple expression of a free man as
to what he considers just, independently of what exists and what is
inculcated upon him.</p>
<p>One free man will truthfully say what he thinks and feels, amidst
thousands of men, who by their acts and words affirm the very opposite.
It would seem that the man who frankly expressed his thought would
remain alone, while in reality it happens that all those men, or the
majority of them, have long been thinking and feeling the same, but have
not expressed their thought. And what yesterday was the new opinion of
one man, to-day becomes the common opinion of all men. And as soon as
this opinion has established itself, men’s acts begin to change
imperceptibly, slowly, but irresistibly.</p>
<p>For, as it is, every free man says to himself: “What can I do against
all this sea of evil and deceit, which inundates me? Why should I give
expression to my thought? Why even give form to it? It is better not to
think of these obscure and intricate questions. Maybe these
contradictions form an inevitable condition of all the phenomena of
life. And why should I alone struggle against all this evil of the
world? Would it not be better if I abandoned myself to the current which
sweeps me along? If anything can be done, it can be done only in
conjunction with other men.”</p>
<p>And, abandoning that powerful instrument of thought and its
expression, which moves the world, this man takes up the instrument of
public activity, without noticing that all public activity is based on
the very principles against which he has to struggle, that in entering
upon any public activity which exists amidst our world, he must at least
partially depart from the truth, make such concessions as will destroy
the whole force of that powerful instrument of the struggle which is
given to him. It is as though a man, into whose hands an unusually sharp
dagger is given, one that cuts everything, should drive in nails with
the blade.</p>
<p>We all deplore the senseless order of life which contradicts all our
existence, and yet not only fail to make use of the one most powerful
tool, which is in our hands,—the recognition of the truth and its
expression,—but, on the contrary, under the pretext of struggling with
evil, destroy this tool and sacrifice it to the imaginary struggle
against this order.</p>
<p>One man does not tell the truth which he knows, because he feels
himself under obligation to the men with whom he is connected;
another,—because the truth might deprive him of the advantageous
position by means of which he is supporting his family; a third,—because
he wants to attain glory and power, to use them later in the service of
men; a fourth,—because he does not wish to violate the ancient sacred
traditions; a fifth,—because the expression of the truth will provoke
persecution and will impair that good public activity to which he is
devoting himself, or intends to devote himself.</p>
<p>One man serves as an emperor, king, minister, official, soldier, and
assures himself and others that the deviation from the truth which is
necessary in his position is more than redeemed by his usefulness.</p>
<p>Another exercises the office of a spiritual pastor, though in the
depth of his heart he does not believe in what he teaches, permitting
himself a deviation from the truth in view of the good which he does. A
third instructs men in literature and, in spite of the suppression of
the whole truth, in order not to provoke the government and society
against himself, has no doubt as to the good which he does; a fourth
simply struggles against the existing order, as do the revolutionists
and anarchists, and is fully convinced that the aim which he pursues is
so beneficent that the suppression of the truth, which is indispensable
in his activity, and even lying will not destroy the good effect of his
activity.</p>
<p>For the order of life which is contrary to the consciousness of men
to give way to one in accord with it, it is necessary for the obsolete
public opinion to give way to a live and new one.</p>
<p>For the old, obsolete public opinion to give way to the new, live
one, it is necessary that the men who are conscious of the new demands
of life should clearly express them. Meanwhile all the men who recognize
all these new demands, one in the name of one thing, and another in the
name of another, not only repress them, but even in words and deeds
confirm what is directly opposed to these demands. Only the truth and
its expression can establish that new public opinion which will change
the obsolete and harmful order of life; we, however, not only do not
express the truth which we know, but frequently even express precisely
what we consider to be an untruth.</p>
<p>If free men would only not depend on what has no force and is never
free,—on external power,—and would always believe in what is always
powerful and free,—in the truth and its expression. If men only
expressed boldly the truth, already revealed to them, about the
brotherhood of all the nations and about the criminality of the
exclusive membership in one nation, the dead, false public opinion, on
which the whole power of the governments is based, and all the evil
produced by them, would fall off by itself like a dried-up skin, and
there would appear that new, live public opinion, which is only waiting
for the sloughing off of the hampering old opinion, in order clearly and
boldly to proclaim its demands and establish the new forms of life in
accordance with the consciousness of men.</p>

<h1>XVIII</h1>
<p>Men need but understand that what is given out to them as public
opinion, what is maintained by such complex and artificial means, is not
public opinion, but only the dead consequence of the quondam public
opinion; they need only, above all, believe in themselves, in this, that
what is cognized by them in the depth of their hearts, what begs for
recognition and finds no expression only because it contradicts public
opinion, is that force which changes the world, and the manifestation of
which forms man’s destiny; men need but believe that the truth is not
what men about him say, but what his conscience, that is, God, says to
him, and immediately there will disappear the false, artificially
sustained public opinion, and the true one will be established.</p>
<p>If men only said what they believe, and did not say what they do not
believe, there would immediately disappear the superstitions that result
from patriotism, and all the evil feelings and all the violence, which
are based on them. There would disappear the hatred and hostility of
states against states and of nationalities against nationalities, which
are fanned by the governments; there would disappear the eulogizing of
military exploits, that is, of murder; there would, above all else,
disappear the respect for the authorities, the surrender of people’s
labours and the submission to them, for which there are no foundations
outside of patriotism.</p>
<p>Let all this be done, and immediately all that vast mass of weak men,
who are always guided from without, will sweep over to the side of the
new public opinion.</p>
<p>And the new public opinion will become the ruling one in the place of
the old public opinion.</p>
<p>Let the governments have possession of the school, the church, the
press, milliards of roubles, and millions of disciplined men turned into
machines,—all that apparently terrible organization of rude force is
nothing in comparison with the recognition of the truth, which arises in
the heart of one man who knows the force of the truth, and is
communicated by this man to another, a third man, just as an endless
number of candles are lighted from one. This light need only burn, and,
like the wax before the face of the fire, all this seemingly so powerful
organization will waste away.</p>
<p>If men only understood that terrible power which is given them in the
word which expresses the truth. If men only did not sell their
birthright for a mess of pottage. If men only made use of this power of
theirs,—the rulers would not only not dare, as they dare now, to
threaten men with universal slaughter, to which they will drive men or
not, as they may see fit, but would not even dare in the sight of
peaceable citizens to bring the disciplined murderers out on parade or
in manoeuvres; the governments would not dare for their own profit, for
the advantage of their accomplices, to make and unmake customs treaties,
and they would not dare to collect from the people those millions of
roubles which they distribute to their accomplices and for which they
prepare themselves for the commission of murder.</p>
<p>And so the change is not only possible, but it is even impossible for
it not to take place, as it is impossible for an overgrown, dead tree
not to rot, and for a young one not to grow. “Peace I leave with you, my
peace I give unto you: not as the world giveth give I unto you; let not
your heart be troubled, neither let it be afraid,” said Christ. And this
peace is actually already among us, and it depends on us to attain
it.</p>
<p>If only the hearts of separate men did not grow faint from those
temptations with which they are tempted every hour, and if they were not
frightened by those imaginary fears with which they are terrified. If
men only knew in what their mighty, all-conquering force consists, the
peace for which men have always wished, not the one which is obtained by
means of diplomatic treaties, journeys of emperors and kings from one
city to another, dinners, speeches, fortresses, cannon, dynamite, and
melanite, but the one which is obtained not by the exhaustion of the
masses by taxes, not by tearing the flower of the population away from
work and debauching them, but by the free profession of the truth by
every separate individual, would long ago have come to us.</p>
