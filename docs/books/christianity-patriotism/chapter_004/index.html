            <h1 id="link-5"><span class="chapter-header">Chapter 4</span><br />IV</h1><p id="para-63">We can with pity listen to the delirium of a feeble, defenceless, crazy old man, in his cap and cloak, and even not contradict him, and even jestingly agree with him; but when it is a whole crowd of sound insane people, who have broken away from their confinement, and these people bristle from head to foot with sharp daggers, swords, and loaded revolvers, and madly flourish these death-dealing weapons, we can no longer agree with them, and we cannot be at rest even for a minute. The same is true of that condition of excitement, provoked by the French celebrations, in which Russian and French society finds itself at the present time.</p>
<p id="para-64">It is true, in all the speeches, in all the toasts, pronounced at these celebrations, in all the articles concerning these celebrations, they never stopped talking of the importance of everything which was taking place for the guarantee of peace. Even the advocates of war did not speak of hatred of those who snatch away provinces, but of some kind of a love which somehow hates.</p>
<p id="para-65">But we know of the slyness of all men who are mentally diseased, and it is this most persistent repetition of our not wanting war, but peace, and the reticence regarding that of which all think, that form a most menacing phenomenon.</p>
<p id="para-66">In answering a toast at a dinner given in the Palace of the Élysées, the Russian ambassador said: “Before drinking a toast to which will respond from the depth of their hearts, not only those who are within these walls, but even those—and, that, too, with equal force—whose hearts near by and far away, at all the points of great, fair France, as also in all of Russia, at the present moment are beating in unison with ours,—permit me to offer to you the expression of our profoundest gratitude for the words of welcome which were addressed by you to our admiral, whom our Tsar has charged with the mission of paying back your visit at Kronstadt. Considering the high importance which you enjoy, your words characterize the true significance of the magnificent <em>peaceful</em> festivities, which are celebrated with such wonderful unanimity, loyalty, and sincerity."</p>
<p id="para-67">The same unjustifiable mention of peace is found in the speech of the French president: “The ties of love, which unite Russia and France,” he said, “and which two years ago were strengthened by touching manifestations, of which our fleet was the object at Kronstadt, become tighter and tighter with every day, and the honourable exchange of our amicable sentiments must inspire all those who take to heart the benefactions of peace, confidence, and security,” and so forth.</p>
<p id="para-68">Both speeches quite unexpectedly and without any cause refer to the benefactions of peace and to peaceful celebrations.</p>
<p id="para-69">The same occurs in the telegrams which were exchanged between the Emperor of Russia and the President of France. The Emperor of Russia telegraphed:</p>
<p id="para-70">"<em>Au moment oil l’escadre russe quitte la France, it me tient а coeur de vous exprimer combien je suis touche et reconnaissant de I’accueil chaleureux et splendide, que mes marins out trouve partout sur le sol français. Les témoignages de vive sympathie qui se sont manifestos encore une fois avec tant d ’eloquence, joindront un nouveau lien a ceux qui unissent les deux pays et contribueront, je l’espère, a V affermissement de la paix generale, objet de leurs efforts et de leurs vœux les plus constants</em>," etc.</p>
<p id="para-71">The President of France in his reply telegraphed as follows:</p>
<p id="para-72">"<em>La dépêche dont je remercie votre Majesté m’est parvenue au moment ou je quittais Toulon pour rentrer a Paris. La belle escadre sur laquelle fai en la vive satisfaction de saluer le pavilion russe dans les eaux françaises, l’accueil cordial et spontané que vos braves marins ont rencontre partout en France affirment une fois de plus avec eclat les sympathies sincères qui unissent nos deux pays. Ils marquent en même temps une foi profonde dans l’influence bienfaisante que peuvent exercer ensemble deux grandes nations dévouées à la cause de la paix.</em>"</p>
<p id="para-73">Again there is in both telegrams a gratuitous mention of peace, which has nothing in common with the celebrations of the sailors.</p>
<p id="para-74">There is not one speech, not one article, in which mention is not made of this, that the aim of all these past orgies is the peace of Europe. At a dinner, which is given by the representatives of the Russian press, everybody speaks of peace. Mr. Zola, who lately wrote about the necessity and even usefulness of war, and Mr. Vogue, who more than once expressed the same idea, do not say one word about war, but speak only of peace. The meetings of the Chambers are opened with speeches respecting the past celebrations, and the orators affirm that these festivities are the declaration of the peace of Europe.</p>
<p id="para-75">It is as though a man, coming into some peaceful society, should go out of his way on every occasion to assure the persons present that he has not the slightest intention of knocking out anybody’s teeth, smashing eyes, or breaking arms, but means only to pass a peaceable evening. “But nobody has any doubts about that,” one feels like saying to him. " But if you have such base intentions, at least do not dare speak of them to us."</p>
<p id="para-76">In many articles, which were written about these celebrations, there is even a direct and naive expression of pleasure, because during the festivities no one gave utterance to what by tacit consent it had been decided to conceal from, everybody, and what only one incautious man, who was immediately removed by the police, dared to shout, giving expression to the secret thought of all, namely, "<em>A bas l’Allemagne!</em>" Thus children are frequently so happy at having concealed their naughtiness, that their very joy gives them away.</p>
<p id="para-77">Why should we so rejoice at the fact that no mention was made of war, if we indeed are not thinking of it?</p>
