            <h1 id="link-10"><span class="chapter-header">Chapter 9</span><br />IX</h1><p id="para-106">After this conversation we went to the mowing, and there he, in the hope of finding more sympathy for his ideas among the masses, asked me to translate to the peasant Prokófi, an old, sickly man, with an enormous rupture, who none the less stuck to his work, and was my companion in the mowing, his plan of attacking the Germans, which was to squeeze the Germans, who were between the French and the Russians, from both sides. The Frenchman gave an ocular demonstration of this to Prokófi, by touching from two sides Prokófi’s sweaty hempen shirt with his white fingers. I recall Prokófi’s good-naturedly scornful surprise, when I explained to him the Frenchman’s words and gestures. The proposition to squeeze the Germans from both sides was apparently taken by Prokófi as a joke, for he would not admit the idea that a grown man and a scholar should calmly and when he was sober talk of the desirability of war.</p>
<p id="para-107">“Well, if we squeeze the German from both sides,” he replied jestingly to what he thought was a joke, “he will have no place to go to. We must give him room.”</p>
<p id="para-108">I translated this to my guest.</p>
<p id="para-109">"<em>Dites lui que nous aimons les Russes</em>," he said.</p>
<p id="para-110">These words obviously startled Prokofi even more than the proposition to squeeze the German, and provoked a certain sentiment of suspicion.</p>
<p id="para-111">“Who is he?” Prokófi asked me, with mistrust, indicating my guest with his head.</p>
<p id="para-112">I told him that he was a Frenchman, a rich man.</p>
<p id="para-113">“What is his business?” Prokófi asked me.</p>
<p id="para-114">When I explained to him that he had come to invite the Russians to form an alliance with France in case of a war with Germany, Prokófi apparently became quite dissatisfied, and, turning to the women, who were sitting near a haycock, he shouted at them in a strong voice, which involuntarily betrayed the feelings which this conversation had provoked in him, that they should go and rake up the unraked hay.</p>
<p id="para-115">“Come now, you crows! Have you fallen asleep? Come! Much time we have to squeeze the German! We have not finished the mowing yet, and it looks likely that we shall be mowing on Wednesday,” he said. And then, as though fearing to offend the stranger by such a remark, he added, displaying his half-worn-off teeth in a good-natured smile, “You had better come and work with us, and send the German, too. When we get through working, we shall have a good time. We’ll take the German along. They are just such folk as we.”, And, having said tins, Prokofi took his muscular arm out of the crotch of the fork, on which he had been leaning, threw the fork over his shoulders, and went away to the women.</p>
<p id="para-116">"<em>Oh, le brave homme!</em>" the polite Frenchman exclaimed, smiling. And with this he then concluded his diplomatic mission to the Russian people.</p>
<p id="para-117">The sight of these so radically different men,–the one beaming with freshness, alacrity, elegance, the well-fed Frenchman, in a silk hat and long overcoat of the latest fashion, energetically illustrating with his white hands, unused to labour, how to squeeze the Germans, and the sight of the dishevelled Prokofi, with hay-seed in his hair, dried up from work, sunburnt, always tired and always working, in spite of his immense rupture, with fingers swollen from work, with his loosely hanging homespun trousers, battered bast shoes, jogging along with an immense forkful of hay over his shoulder in that indolent pace of a labouring man, which economizes motion,–the sight of these two so radically different men elucidated to me then many things, and has occurred to me now, after the Toulon-Paris celebrations. One of them personified all those men, nurtured by the labours of the masses, who later use these masses as food for cannon; and Prokófi personified to me that food for cannon, which nurtures and makes secure the men who dispose of it.</p>
