</p>
            <h1 id="link-2"><span class="chapter-header">Chapter 1</span><br />I</h1><p id="para-2">Russians and Frenchmen have lived for many centuries, knowing one another, entering with one another at times into friendly, more often, I am sorry to say, into very hostile relations, which have been provoked by their governments; suddenly, because two years ago a French squadron arrived at Kronstadt, and the officers of the squadron, upon landing, ate and drank a lot of wine in various places, hearing and uttering upon these occasions many lying and stupid words, and because, in the year 1893, a similar Russian squadron arrived at Toulon, and the officers of the Russian squadron ate and drank a lot in Paris, hearing and uttering upon that occasion more lying and stupid words than before, it happened that not only the men who ate, drank, and talked, but even those who were present, and even those who were not present, but only heard and read of it iu newspapers, all these millions of Russians and Frenchmen suddenly imagined that they somehow were particularly in love with one another, that is, that all the French loved all the Russians, and all the Russians loved all the French.</p>
<p id="para-3">These sentiments were last October expressed in France in a most unusual manner.</p>
<p id="para-4">Here is the way the reception of the Russian sailors is described in the <em>Rural Messenger</em>, a newspaper which collects its information from all the others:</p>
<p id="para-5">“At the meeting of the Russian and French vessels, both, besides the salvos of guns, greeted one another with hearty, ecstatic shouts, ‘Hurrah,’ ‘Long live Russia,’ ‘Long live France!’</p>
<p id="para-6">“These were joined by bands of music (which came on many private steamers), playing the Russian hymn, ‘God save the Tsar,’ and the French Marseillaise; the public on the private vessels waved their hats, flags, handkerchiefs, and bouquets; on many barques there were peasants with their wives and children, and they all had bouquets in their hands, and even the children waved the bouquets and shouted at the top of their voices, '<em>Vive la Russie!</em>' Our sailors, upon seeing such national transport, were unable to restrain their tears...</p>
<p id="para-7">“In the harbour all the ships-of-war which were then at Toulon were drawn out in two lines, and our squadron passed between them; in front was the ironclad of the admiralty, and this was followed by the rest. There ensued a most solemn minute.</p>
<p id="para-8">" On the Russian ironclad, fifteen salvos were fired in honour of the French squadron, and a French ironclad replied with double the number, with thirty salvos. From the French vessels thundered the sounds of the Russian hymn. The French sailors climbed up on the sail-yards and masts; loud exclamations of greeting proceeded uninterruptedly from the two squadrons and from the private vessels; the caps of the sailors, the hats aud handkerchiefs of the public,—all were thrown up triumphantly in honour of the dear guests. On all sides, on the water and on the shore, there boomed one common call, ‘Long live Russia! Long live France!’</p>
<p id="para-9">“In conformity with naval law, Admiral Avelan and the officers of his staff landed, in order to greet the local authorities. On the quay the Russian sailors were met by the chief marine staff of France and the superior officers of the port of Toulon. There ensued a universal friendly hand-shaking, accompanied by the boom of cannon and the ringing of bells. A band of marine music played the hymn ‘God save the Tsar,’ drowned by the thunderous shouts of the public, ‘Long live the Tsar! Long live Russia!’ These exclamations blended into one mighty sound, which drowned the music and the salvos from the guns.</p>
<p id="para-10">“Eye-witnesses declare that at this moment the enthusiasm of the innumerable mass of people reached its highest limits, and that it is impossible to express in words with what sensations the hearts of all those present were filled. Admiral Avelan, with bared head, and accompanied by Russian and French officers, directed his steps to the building of the Marine Office, where the French minister of marine was waiting for him.</p>
<p id="para-11">“In receiving the admiral, the minister said: ‘Kronstadt and Toulon are two places which bear witness to the sympathy between the Russian and the French nations; you will everywhere be met as dear friends. The government and all of France welcome you upon your arrival and that of your companions, who represent a great and noble nation.’</p>
<p id="para-12">“The admiral replied that he was not able to express all his gratitude. The Russian squadron and all of Russia,’ he said, ‘will remember the reception you have given us.’</p>
<p id="para-13">“After a short conversation, the admiral, saying goodbye to the minister, a second time thanked him for the reception, and added, ‘I do not want to part from you before pronouncing those words which are imprinted in all Russian hearts: “Long live France!”’” (<em>Rural Messenger</em>, 1893, No. 41.)</p>
<p id="para-14">Such was the meeting at Toulon. In Paris the meeting and the celebrations were more remarkable still.</p>
<p id="para-15">Here is the way the meeting in Paris was described in the newspapers: “All eyes were directed to the Boulevard des Italiens, whence the Russian sailors were to appear. Finally the boom of a whole hurricane of exclamations and applauses is heard in the distance. The boom grows stronger and more audible. The hurricane is apparently approaching. A mighty motion takes place on the square. Policemen rush forward to clear a path toward the Cercle Militaire, but this is by no means an easy task. There is an incredible crush and pressure in the crowd... Finally the head of the procession appears in the square. At the same moment a deafening shout, '<em>Vive la Russie! Vive les Russes!</em>' rises over it. All bare their heads, the public, packed close in the windows, on the balconies, perched even on the roofs, wave handkerchiefs, flags, and hats, applaud madly, and from the windows of the upper stories throw clouds of small many-coloured cockades. A whole sea of handkerchiefs, hats, and flags surges above the heads of the crowd in the square: '<em>Vive la Russie! Vive les Russes!</em>' shouts this mass of one hundred thousand people, trying to get a look at the dear guests, extending their hands to them, and in every way expressing their sympathies" (<em>New Time</em>).</p>
<p id="para-16">Another correspondent writes that the transport of the crowd bordered on delirium. A Russian publicist, who was in Paris at that time, describes this entrance of the sailors in the following manner: “They tell the truth,—it was an incident of world-wide import, wondrous, touching, soul-stirring, making the heart quiver with that love which discerns the brothers in men, and which detests bloodshed and concomitant acts of violence, the tearing away of the children from their beloved mother. I have been in some kind of an intoxication for several hours. I felt so strange, and even so weak, as I stood at the station of the Lyons Railway, among the representatives of the French administration in their gold-embroidered uniforms, among the members of the municipality in full dress, and heard the shouts, '<em>Vive la Russie! Vive le Czar!</em>' and our national hymn, which was played several times in succession. Where am I? What has happened? What magic stream has united all this into one feeling, into one mind? Does one not feel here the presence of the God of love and brotherhood, the presence of something higher, something ideal, which descends upon men only in lofty moments? The heart is so full of something beautiful and pure and exalted, that the pen is not able to express it all. Words pale before what I saw, what I felt. It is not transport,—the word is too banal,—it is something better than transport. It is more picturesque, profounder, more joyous, more varied. It is impossible to describe what happened at the Cercle Militaire, when Admiral Avelan appeared on the balcony of a second story. Words will not tell anything here. During the Те Deum, when the choristers sang in the church ‘Save, О Lord, thy people,’ there burst through the open door the solemn sounds of the Marseillaise, which was played in the street by an orchestra of wind-instruments. There was something astounding and inexpressible in the impression conveyed" (<em>New Time</em>, October, 1893).</p>
