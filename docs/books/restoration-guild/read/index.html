<h1>Preface</h1>
<p>Readers of the following pages will probably be aware that the idea
of restoring the Guild system as a solution of the problems presented by
modern industrialism is to be found in the writings of John Ruskin, who
put forward the proposition many years ago.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, however, as Ruskin failed to formulate any practical
scheme showing how the Guilds could be re-established in society, the
proposal has never been seriously considered by social reformers.
Collectivism may be said to have stepped into the breach by offering a
plausible theory for the reconstruction of society on a cooperative
basis, and Ruskin’s suggestion was incontinently relegated to the region
of impractical dreams.</p>
<p>My reason for reviving the idea is that while I am persuaded that
Collectivism is incapable of solving the social problem, the conviction
is forced upon me that our only hope lies in some such direction as that
foreshadowed by Ruskin, and in the following chapters I hope to show
that it is not impossible to discover practical ways and means of
re-establishing the Guilds in our midst.</p>
<p>In order to understand the full significance of the present proposals
they should be considered in conjunction with the theory put forward by
Mr. Edward Carpenter in “Civilization, Its Cause and Cure.” Indeed the
present volume aims at forging the links required to connect the theory
there enunciated with practical politics.</p>
<p>Two other books which have an important bearing on the subject, and
might be read with advantage, are Carlyle’s “Past and Present” and
Matthew Arnold’s “Culture and Anarchy.”</p>

<h1>The Collectivist Formula</h1>
<p>Among the schemes which have been put forward as solutions of the
social problem, Collectivism,, by reason of its close relationship to
current problems, has alone secured any measure of popularity. Having
discovered that “unfettered individual competition is not a principle to
which the regulation of industry may be entrusted,” political
philosophers rush to the opposite extreme, and propose to remedy the
defect, first by the regulation, and finally by the nationalization of
land, capital, and the means of production and exchange; which measures,
we are told, by changing the basis of society from a competitive to a
cooperative one, will, by providing the necessary conditions, eradicate
every disease from the body politic.</p>
<p>Such a remedy would be perfectly reasonable if the evil to be
combated were that of competition. But it is not. It is true that
competition, as it manifests itself in modern society, is a force of
social disintegration. But this is not because it is necessarily an evil
thing; but because the conditions under which it is to-day pursued are
intrinsically bad. That the competition of to-day differs from that of
the past, we unconsciously recognize when we speak of commercial
competition. Competition as it existed under the Guild System, when
hours and conditions of labour, prices, etc., were fixed, was
necessarily a matter of quality; for when no producer was allowed to
compete on the lower plane of cheapness, competition took the form of a
rivalry in respect to the greater usefulness or beauty of the thing
produced. With the passing of the control of industry from the hands of
the craft-masters into those of the financier and the abolition of the
regulations of the Guilds, the era of commercial competition was
inaugurated, and what was formerly a healthy and stimulating factor
became a dangerous and disintegrating reactionary force; for competition
between financiers means a competition for cheapness, to which all other
considerations must be sacrificed.</p>
<p>For the sake of clearness, therefore, we will define the terms
competition and commercialism, as follows: Commercialism means the
control of industry by the financier (as opposed to the master
craftsman) while competition means the rivalry of producers.</p>
<p>Viewing Collectivism in this light, we find that it seeks to
eliminate, not commercialism, but competition. In so doing it
establishes more securely than ever the worst features of the present
system. The mere transference of the control of industry from the hands
of the capitalist into those of the state, can make no essential
difference to the nature of the industry affected. In Belgium, for
example, where the bread-making and shirt-making industries have been
nationalized, it has been found impossible to abolish sweating, or to
introduce a shorter working day.This abandonment of the principle of
social justice at the outset doubtless foreshadows its abandonment for
ever; since, as Collectivists become more and more concerned with
practical politics, the difficulties of asserting their ideals, together
with the establishment of their system of organization, will likewise be
more and more increased. Moreover, after its establishment, the
difficulties of reforming any State Department are well known; and how
shall society be prevented from acquiescing in the present commercial
abuses, under a collectivist <em>régime</em>, and treating them as
inevitable evils?</p>
<p>This question is a very pertinent one, since, according to the
economics of Collectivism, every industry nationalized must be made to
pay, and a Government charged with the administration of any industry
would become interested in its continuance as a business, quite apart
from its usefulness or otherwise, or whether or no it had been called
into existence by some temporary and artificial need of modern
civilization. Thus the Government at the present time, having
nationalized the telegraphs, becomes interested in the continuance of
gambling, the use of the system in connexion with the turf and the
markets being its real basis of support, and not the comparatively
insignificant percentage of work undertaken in respect to the more human
agencies which require it. Again, were existing railways nationalized,
Government would become interested in the continuance of wasteful cross
distribution, called into existence by the competition of traders.
Similarly, the gradual development of municipal trading and manufacture
would tend to militate against the depopulation of towns. And this
conservative tendency is inevitable, since Collectivism can only
maintain its ground as a national system so long as it justifies the
claims of its advocates to financial soundness.</p>
<p>Co-operation in its inception aimed at the establishment of an ideal
commonwealth, but the cooperative ideal has long since departed from the
movement, and little but a scramble for dividends remains. In like
manner it is not unreasonable to suppose that Collectivism, having made
its appeal for popular support on the grounds of its capacity to earn
profits for the public, would suffer a similar degeneration. The
electorate, in their profit-making zeal, would certainly not remedy
abuses if their dividends were to be lowered, for they would still
retain the superstition that only by producing dividends could their
finances be kept in a healthy condition. Inasmuch as the ultimate
control of industry would rest in the hands of the financier, production
for profit and not for use would continue. For what other test can there
be of a financier’s skill except his ability to produce profits?</p>
<p>In a word Collectivism means State Commercialism.</p>
<p>So long as the people are attached to their present habits of life
and thought, and possess the same ill-regulated tastes, a State
Department, charged with the administration of industry, would be just
as much at the mercy of supply and demand as at present, while the
fluctuations of taste would be just as disturbing to them as the
fluctuations of public opinion are to the politician.</p>
<p>This brings us to the great political fallacy of the Collectivist
doctrine—namely, the assumption that Government should be conducted
solely in the interests of man in his capacity as consumer—a
superstition which has survived the Manchester School; for a little
consideration will convince us that in a true social system the aim of
Government would not be to exalt either producer or consumer at the
expense of the other, but to maintain a balance of power between the
two.</p>
<p>The policy of exalting the consumer at the expense of the producer
would be perfectly sound, if the evils of the present day were caused by
the tyranny of the producer. But is it so? It is true that trade is in
such a hopeless condition that the consumer is very much at the mercy of
unscrupulous producers. The cause of this, however, is not to be found
in the preference of producers generally for crooked ways, but in the
tyranny of consumers which forces the majority of producers to adopt
malpractices in self-defence. Doubtless all trade abuses have in their
origin been the work of individual producers. They grow, in the first
place, because without privileges the more honourable producers are
powerless to suppress them, and secondly, because consumers generally
are so wanting in loyalty to honest producers, and are so ready to
believe that they can get sixpenny-worth of stuff” for threepence, that
they deliberately place themselves in the hands of the worst type of
producer. In every department of life the successful man is he who can
lead the public to believe they are getting something for nothing, and
generally speaking, if consumers are defrauded by producers, it is
because they deserve to be. The truth of this statement will be attested
by all who, in any department of industry, have made efforts to raise
its tone. Everywhere it is the tyranny of the consumer that blocks the
way. For example, anybody who has followed the history of the Arts and
Crafts movement, and noted the efforts which have been made to raise the
quality of English production must be convinced that this is the root of
the difficulty. If the public were capable of a tenth part of the
sacrifice which others have undertaken on their behalf, we might see our
way out of the industrial quagmire.</p>
<p>This evil would not be remedied by bringing industry under State
Control. Rather would it be intensified. Art in the past had its private
patrons, and while these continue some good work may still be done. But
the artist is powerless when face to face with a public body whose taste
recognizes no ultimate standard, but taken collectively is always the
reflection of the vulgarity its members see around them. As we may
assume that private patrons would cease under Collectivism, so Art’s
last support would disappear also. Whatever good work has been done for
the public during the past century has been in the main the result of
accident. Collective control foreshadows, not the abolition of poverty
in our midst, by the direction of industry passing into the hands of
wise administrators, but the final abandonment of all standards of
quality in production, owing to the complete subjection of all producers
to the demoralizing tyranny of an uninstructed majority.</p>
<p>This commercial notion of Government solely in the interests of
consumers leads the Collectivist into strange company. It leads him to
acquiesce in such a pernicious system as the division of labor. Ruskin
claimed that the subjective standard of human happiness, not the
objective monetary standard assumed! by previous political economists,
was the final test of the social utility of production. If we accept
Ruskin’s position, surely we must consider man primarily in his capacity
as producer. From this standpoint a man’s health, mental and moral, must
depend upon the amount of pleasure he can take in his work. But we
deprive the worker of this means of happiness and strive to replace it
by such institutions as free libraries and popular lectures, which all
lie outside the sphere of his real life. This policy would appear to be
based on the idea that man should live a conscious double life. In the
first place he must submit to any indignity he may be called upon to
suffer by the prevailing system of industry, and secondly, he should aim
in his leisure time at self-improvement. He thus destroys in the morning
what he has built over-night. Like a mad sculler who pulls both ways at
once he describes a rapid circle, and giddily imagines he is making
immense progress forward. To unite these warring forces in man and to
make him once more simple, harmonious and whole, he must again be
regarded first and foremost in his capacity as producer.</p>
<p>Another reason for the primary consideration of the producer, which
should be interesting to the democrat is that to legislate on the basis
that all are consumers, while only some are producers, is obviously to
put a premium upon idleness, for only the idle consume without
producing. This fundamental defect of reasoning has thus rendered
possible the paradox that while the Manchester School expended its moral
indignation in protesting against idleness and luxury, by the very
measures it advocated have idleness and luxury been mainly
increased.</p>
<p>Let us pass on to a consideration of the principles of Collectivism
in their application to particular problems. With regard to the question
of Trusts, Collectivists assert that industries will become more and
more subject to their domination, and that the State is then to step in
and nationalize them.</p>
<p>Now, if we look at the matter carefully, we shall find that the
development of industry into Trusts is by no means universal. It holds
good in those branches of industry which deal with the supply of raw
materials, in distribution, in railways and other monopolies, in the
branches of production where mechanism plays an all important part and
which command universal markets. On the other hand, there are branches
of industry where no such development can be traced. It does not apply
to those industries which, in the nature of things, rely upon local
markets, such as the building trades; nor to those in which the element
of taste enters, as the furnishing and clothing trades. It is true that
the large capitalist exists in these trades, but this does not mean that
the small builder, furnisher and clothier will eventually be thrust out
of the market. The big contractor exists in the building trades, not
because he can produce more cheaply than the smaller one, as a careful
comparison of prices would show; nor is it because the work is better
done, his <em>raison d’être</em> is rather to be found in the
circumstance that large building contrails can only be undertaken by
builders possessed of large capital. Again, the existence of large firms
in the furnishing and clothing trades cannot be taken as an indication
of the growth of efficiency in those trades, such reduction of cost as
has taken place having been obtained in the main at the expense of true
efficiency; while again, the growth of large retail houses is in no
sense due to a reduction of prices, rather has it been due in some
measure to the same causes which brought the large building firms into
existence, and to the system of advertising which leads an ignorant
public to suppose they are getting a superior article for their money.
Nay, if we go further into the matter, we shall find that so far from
these huge organizations securing a higher degree of efficiency in
production than smaller firms, they owe their very existence to the
general degradation of industry—to the fact that the craftsman has so
declined in skill, that he has become the cat’s-paw of capitalism. It is
only where craftsmanship has declined, and the skilled craftsman has
been replaced by the mechanical drudge, that capitalist control secures
a firm foothold. It cannot be insisted upon too strongly that capitalist
organization, whether private or public, is built upon and presupposes
the degradation of the craftsman. Being organized for the production of
indifferent work, they are normally working incapable of anything else;
for in the production of good work, the craftsman must have liberty to
follow the line of a consecutive tradition—a condition which capitalist
organization denies, its function being not to develop a tradition of
design in handicraft but to adjust the efforts of the craftsman to the
whims of a capricious public.</p>
<p>This view, which was originally formed from personal observation and
experience of the conditions now obtaining in industry, is amply
corroborated by the testimony of Prince Kropotkin. In “Fields, Factories
and Workshops,” he says: “The petty trades at Paris so much prevail over
the factories that the average number of workman employed in the 98,000
factories and workshops of Paris is less than <em>six</em>, while the
number of persons employed in workshops which have less than five
operatives is almost twice as large as the number of persons employed in
the large establishments. In fad:, Paris is a great bee-hive where
hundreds and thousands of men and women fabricate in small workshops all
possible varieties of goods which require taste, skill and invention.
These small workshops, in which artistic finish and rapidity of work are
so much praised, necessarily stimulate the mental powers of the
producer; and we may safely admit that if the Paris workmen are
generally considered, and really are, more developed intellectually than
the workers of any other European capital, this is due to a great extent
to the work they are engaged in… and the question naturally arises: Must
all this skill, all this intelligence, be swept away by the factory,
instead of becoming a new fertile source of progress under a better
organization of production? must all this inventiveness of the worker
disappear before the factory levelling? and if it must, would such a
transformation be a progress as so many economists, who have only
studied figures and not human beings, are ready to maintain?”</p>
<p>Kropotkin here lays his finger on the weak point of modern
sociological theories. They are based upon estimates of figures rather
than estimates of men. The correct statement of this issue is perhaps to
be found in the dictum that organization on a large scale secures
efficiency up to a certain point, which varies in each industry, and
when that point is reached, degeneration sets in. On the one hand the
quality of the work declines, while on the other, administrative
expenses show a tendency to increase out of their proper proportion,
owing to the fact that personal control gradually disappears; and this
is probably one of the causes which oblige many large firms gradually to
adopt sweating practices. Expenses must be cut down somewhere, and the
workers have to suffer.</p>
<p>And now that we have found Collectivist prognostications respecting
the future of the Factory system to be based upon insufficient data, let
us turn to Collectivist opinions respecting the future of machinery; in
this connexion we observe that Collectivism teaches that machinery will
be used more in the future than at present. The circumstance that many
who identify themselves with Collectivism hold to the idea of William
Morris, and quote him on sundry occasions, in no wise affects the
Collectivist position, which is antagonistic to that held by Morris.
Morris’s opposition to machinery was based in the first place upon the
perception that there is no temperament in work produced by machinery,
and in the next upon a recognition of the principle that its use tended
to separate the artist and craftsman more widely than ever, whereas the
restoration of industry to health demands their reunion.</p>
<p>But how is a reunion possible under a Collectivist régime? Surely if
social evolution has separated the artist and craftsman, further
progress along present lines must tend to separate them still further,
and not to draw them together. Hence it is we feel justified in
identifying Collectivism with the mechanical ideal of industry.</p>
<p>It may be said that the solution of our problems is to be found in a
further development towards mechanical perfection, and this contention
would be perfectly reasonable if the object of man’s existence were to
make cotton and buttons as cheaply as possible; but considering that man
has a soul which craves some satisfaction, and that the progress of
mechanical invention degrades and stultifies it by making man more and
more the slave of the machine, we feel justified in asserting that real
progress lies along other lines. Up to a certain point it is true that
mechanical invention is for the benefit of the community, but such
inventions must be distinguished from the mass of mechanical
contrivances which are the humble slaves of commercialism, and witnesses
to the diseased state of society. To invent a machine to reduce the
amount of drudgery in the world may reasonably be claimed as an
achievement of Science; but to reduce all labour to the level of
drudgery, to exploit Science for commercial purposes, is an entirely
different matter. Machinery being a means to an end, we may test its
social utility by considering the desirability or otherwise of the ends
it is to serve. And what are the ends which have determined the
application of machinery to modern industry? Not the satisfaction of
human needs, or the production of beautiful things, but primarily the
satisfaction of the money-making instinct, which, it goes without
saying, is undesirable. There are very few things which machinery can do
as well as hand labour, and so far as my personal knowledge extends,
there is nothing it can do better. Hand riveted boilers are preferred to
machine riveted ones; while the most delicate scientific instruments
have to be made by hand. In fact, wherever careful fitting is valued the
superiority of handwork is acknowledged. In the crafts, on the other
hand, machinery is valueless, except for heavy work, such as sawing
timber; though even here, where timber is exposed to view, it suffers in
comparison with hand sawing and hewing, which has more temperament about
it. In production, therefore, the only ultimate use of machinery to the
community is that in certain heavy work it saves labour, which,
considered from the point of view of the development of the physique of
the race, is of very questionable advantage; or that it reduces the cost
of production. This again, however, is a doubtful advantage, since the
increase of material possessions beyond a certain point is extremely
undesirable. Without machinery there would be plenty for all and to
spare, if it were not for the greed of individuals; and machinery, by
facilitating the production of goods in immense quantities, so far from
eliminating the spirit of avarice by satisfying it, appears only to give
it a cumulative force. Machinery has creeled the most effective class
barrier yet devised. Again, considered in relation to locomotion the
benefits of mechanism are very doubtful. If railways and steamboats have
brought Chicago nearer to London, the world is more commonplace in
consequence, and it is very much open to question whether the romance,
the beauty, and the mystery of the world which mechanism seems so happy
in destroying, may not in the long run prove to be the things most worth
possessing, and the hurry and dispatch which are everywhere welcomed as
the heralds of progress, admitted to be illusory.</p>
<p>Then Collectivists are in a quandary over the Fiscal Question.
Finding themselves unable to accept either the position of the
Protectionists or that of the Free Traders, the Fabian Society has
formulated a scheme which is supposed to harmonize with the principles
of Collectivism. In the tract entitled “Fabianism and the Fiscal
Question,” the Society suggests, as a solution for the present crisis,
that the trading fleet between ourselves and the colonies be
impersonalized, when the conveyance of goods might be made free to all.
Surely this would not lead towards Collectivism; rather would it
intensify one of the worst evils of the present system which
Collectivism proposes to cure—namely, the evil of cross
distribution.</p>
<p>This brings me to the question of universal markets, which
Collectivists generally assume to be a permanent factor in industry.</p>
<p>To some extent, of course, this will be so, and we must at the outset
differentiate between a certain legitimate trade which in the nature of
things must always exist, and its present abnormal development, which
can only be regarded as symptomatic of disease.</p>
<p>That India should export tea to us appears quite reasonable, but why
we should export cotton goods to India is not so clear. The former is a
natural trade, because climatic conditions will not permit us to grow
our own tea. The latter, however, is not ultimately rooted in actuality,
but owes its existence to the creation of artificial conditions, to the
circumstance that machinery for the purpose was first invented in
Lancashire, and to the fact that we exploited foreign markets for our
benefit in consequence. But this may not last. In the long run India
must be able to manufacture cotton goods for herself, if the test to be
applied is merely that of comparative cost, but when we remember that
there are other factors in production which ought to be considered, and
which will be taken into account when man re-awakens to the fact that
profit is not the Alpha and Omega of production, the change is certain.
The re-establishments of just standards of quality in production by the
revival of art and the restoration of a sense of morality in trade
demand the substitution of local for universal markets.</p>
<p>Of this there can be no question. For it is evident that one at least
of the conditions of the restoration of the moral sense. in trade is
that the cash nexus be supplanted by the personal nexus in trade
relation, and this can only be possible under social conditions in which
producer and consumer are known to each other. While again it may be
argued that so long as universal markets are regarded as essential to
trade, industry must continue to be of a speculative character, owing to
the circumstance that supply precedes demand. To reverse this unnatural
order of things is essential to production for use, and this involves,
among other things, the restoration of local markets.</p>
<p>In like manner the necessities of Art demand the restoration of local
markets. If beauty is ever to be restored, and the ordinary things of
life are to be once more beautiful, it is certain that local markets
will have to be restored. If Art were healthy the wholesale importation
of articles of foreign manufacture would not obtain. An artistic public
would, for the most part, demand goods of local manufacture, the beauty
of which reflected those experiences common to their own life. Thus the
English would not import Japanese Art, to any extent, recognizing that,
though Japanese Art is admirable in Japan, it is yet so entirely out of
sympathy with Western Art as to introduce an element of discord when
placed in an English room; while again, for the same reason, the
Japanese would not import English Art.</p>
<p>A possible objection to this assumption is that in the most vigorous
periods of art a considerable trade was carried on in exchanging the
artistic works of different countries, that, in fa6l, many of the finest
examples of craftsmanship which were distributed over Europe in the
Middle Ages and earlier often emanated from one centre. For instance,
carved ivories were mostly made in Alexandria, and so far from the trade
which existed in them acting in a way derogatory to the interests of
Art, they, as a matter of fact, exercised a very stimulating influence
upon the art of the age. To this I answer, that such a trade, which
exists for the exchange of treasure, is a fundamentally different thing
from a trade which exchanges the ordinary commodities of life, since
while the former may operate to widen the outlook in the artistic sense,
the effect of the latter is to precipitate all traditions of design into
hopeless confusion and anarchy, because, when carried on on a large
scale, production for foreign markets does not take the form of sending
to other countries specimens of the best craftsmanship which a nation
can produce, but of supplying cheap imitations of the genuine and native
craftsmanship to other lands a most ruinous commerce; for while abroad
the underselling of native craftsmanship tends to destroy the living
traditions of those countries, its operations are no less harmful at
home, by their tendency to confuse rather than consolidate a national
tradition of design.</p>
<p>In the long run a universal trade in everyday commodities could only
be favourable to Art on the assumption that internationalism were the
condition of healthy artistic activity. And this is not so. An
international art would involve the gradual elimination of all that is
of local and provincial interest; and when this elimination is complete
there is very little left. It would not be untrue to say that the
Renaissance failed because its ideas were international, it strove to
eliminate all that was of merely local interest in art, and the result
was a final and complete imbecility such as never before existed.</p>
<p>Similarly, when we turn to consider the financial side of
Collectivism we discover similar fallacies. The nationalization of
capital does not recommend itself to us as a solution of present day
financial difficulties, since, according to one point of view the
economic difficulty arises not so much from an unequal distribution of
wealth as from the fact that so much of the labour of the community
produces not wealth but “illth,” to use Ruskin’s word. The capital we
account for in the columns of the ledger is, indeed, only of a very
theoretical character. For, in spite of statistical calculations (which
to all appearances may be used to prove anything it is desired to
prove), we are not becoming richer, but poorer every year, and this we
believe is to be accounted for by our system of finance, which, not
studying things, but only the profit and loss account of them, fails to
distinguish between what are assets and what are liabilities.</p>
<p>As an illustration of what I mean let us take a concrete instance
Tramways. Now it is evident that from the point of view of the private
capitalist, whose aim is the making of profit, that the possession of a
tramway is to be reckoned as an asset. From the point of view of the
community, however, it is altogether different. A municipal tramway is
not an asset, but a liability in the national ledger. It is true that
the possession of a tramway by a municipality enables the community to
intercept profits which otherwise would swell the pockets of the private
capitalist, but this does not constitute such a tramway a public asset;
it merely decreases the liability. A tramway is a liability because it
is not one of the ultimate needs of human society, but an artificial
one, arising through the abnormal growth of big towns and cross
distribution. If a man has to travel from New Cross to the City every
day for employment he helps the tramway to pay its dividends, but he is
the poorer for having to take the journey. He is perhaps richer by the
time he saves as compared with the time he would lose in having to walk.
But the fact that a man lives in one part of the town and works in
another is itself an evil—reduced to the terms of national finance it is
a liability, and no juggling of figures can make it into anything else.
Hence it is that while convenience may suggest the expediency of
municipalities owning their own tramways, we are not justified in
reckoning them as national assets, or in supposing that the change from
private to public ownership is a step in the solution of the social
problem.</p>
<p>The same test may be applied to all the activities of Society—though
the application of the principle will be very difficult. For exactly
what in civilization will constitute an asset, and what a liability,
will often be most difficult to determine. Perhaps on due consideration
it may appear that civilization itself is entirely of the nature of a
liability which man pays for by the sweat of his brow; that the secret
of the present financial crisis is that civilization has become so
artificial that he cannot pay the price demanded. At any rate, the more
we reduce the number of our wants the richer intrinsically we become as
a nation. Hence it appears to me that granting, for the sake of
argument, that the nationalization of industry is possible, the proper
course of action to adopt would be not to commence with the
nationalization of the means of distribution, but with production,
beginning at the bottom of the industrial scale with agriculture, and
building up step by step from this bedrock of actuality, taking care
always to avoid the multiplication of works of a temporary character,
and building for posterity. It is precisely because ever since the
commencement of the era of commercialism, we have individually and
collectively proceeded upon the principle of letting posterity take care
of itself, that society has become burdened with the maintenance of an
ever increasing number of institutions to satisfy the temporary needs of
society, that we are becoming poorer.</p>
<p>Closely allied to the foregoing financial fallacy, and in some
measure the cause of it, is the more or less unconscious acceptance by
Collectivists of the opinion held by the Utilitarian Philosophers that
the expenditure of surplus wealth upon art does not operate in the
interests of the community. This is an error since from the point of
view of national finance such expenditure provides a safety valve which
prevents internal complications. The cutting down of expenditure upon
Art does not, as Political Economists appear to argue, benefit the
people, owing to the direction of surplus wealth into new productive
enterprises, rather in the long run has it proved to have the opposite
effect of aggravating the problem. Let us take an illustration.</p>
<p>A hundred men are engaged in production; let us make an artificial
distinction, and say that seventy-five are engaged in the production of
physical necessities, and twenty-five in the production of art (using
the word art to indicate those things which do not directly contribute
to the maintenance of the body). A machine is invented which enables
fifty men to do the work which hitherto had given employment to
seventy-five. The balance of production is now destroyed, for there will
be a hundred men competing for seventy-five places. It is evident,
therefore, if the balance in production is to be restored, one of two
things must be done; either the hours of labour must be reduced all
round, or the surplus profit created (be it in the hands of Consumer or
Producer), must be used in employing the twenty-five displaced men upon
the production of Art. Other factors may come in and modify the problem,
such as the increased demand for utilities owing to their reduced price,
but they are relatively insignificant owing to the fact that as it is
not customary under such circumstances to raise the wages of the
workers, the limit of the consumption of utilities is practically fixed.
Neglecting this arrangement to provide employment for the displaced
twenty-five men, disease is spread throughout industry by the
destruction of the balance between demand and supply. They must find
employment somehow, and so it happens under our commercial society they
are used for fighting purposes, becoming travellers or touts in the
competitive warfare for the trade which is now insufficient to give
employment to all would-be workers. The benefit which the invention of
the machine should bring to society is thus lost. The ultimate effect is
not to cheapen but to increase the cost of commodities, since it tends
to swallow up even the normal profits in fighting machinery, and prices
have to be raised, or the quality lowered to make up the difference.</p>
<p>But the evil does not end here. For now, when the markets are filled
to overflowing, there can be no mistaking the evil resulting from the
practice to which an almost religious sanction has been given by our
Political Economists, of systematically re-investing surplus wealth in
new productive enterprises, since it tends to reduce wages by the
over-capitalization of industry in addition to raising the cost of
commodities. The congested state of our markets makes it exceedingly
difficult for new industrial enterprises to be successfully floated.
Investment is consequently taking the form of converting private
businesses into limited liability Companies. Thus a private business
with a real capital of say £50,000 is floated as a Company with a
nominal capital of £75,000; the extra £25,000 going in goodwill and
promotion expenses. And now that the business has more Capital it will
be apparent that to maintain the same dividends as hitherto (necessary
to maintain credit, if for nothing else), expenses must be reduced in
every direction. Hence it generally happens that when a private firm is
converted into a Company, unless a strong Trade Union exists, wages are
cut down; if a Union prevents this, the old men are discharged to make
room for younger and more energetic ones, while no opportunity is lost
of increasing the price of commodities to the public or of adulterating
the article to reduce its cost.</p>
<p>This, it is safe to say, is substantially what is taking place
to-day. Yet, on the whole, Collectivists, while incidentally regretting
the reduction of wages, welcome the change as a step towards the
nationalization of capital. To me, however, this change wears a
different aspect, for it is obvious that so long as we continue to
accept the present principle of finance—that all capital should produce
interest—and to harbour the utilitarian fallacy that expenditure upon
Art is a dead loss to the community, the over-capitalization of industry
must tend to increase. The fundamental fact is that so long as the
present principles of finance remain unchallenged, the mere transference
of capital from private to public ownership can have no appreciable
effect on the problem, since a public body accepting these theories
must, like a private manufacturer, put the interests of capital before
the interests of life—and between these two there is eternal
conflict.</p>
<p>The current commercial practice of reinvesting dividends is directly
responsible for the development of class separation by withdrawing money
from circulation where it is needed and causing it to circulate in
orbits where it is not required. Whilst on the human side it is
responsible for the great contrasts of extravagance and poverty in
modern society, on the industrial side it has struck at the roots of all
healthy production. It impoverishes works of real utility to create
surpluses to be spent upon works of luxury—making Art an exotic and
artificial thing, since its true basis is in utility and not in luxury.
For it is one of the paradoxes of our so-called utilitarian age that it
is always impossible to get sufficient money spent on real utilities to
make them substantial. We first impoverish works of real utility, and
having thus succeeded in rendering all useful labour utterly
unendurable, we expend the surpluses in providing such diversions as
free libraries, art galleries, and such like.</p>
<p>Yet why should utilities be expected to pay dividends? Why should it
always be assumed that what is intended for use should yield a profit,
and what is intended for luxury not? Why, for instance, in municipal
expenditure should it be assumed that houses for the working classes
should be self-supporting, while art galleries and free libraries are a
charge upon the rates? Why should not some of the money which is spent
upon these things be spent in making municipal houses more beautiful?
And if it be right for one thing not to pay dividends, why not another?
Frankly, I can see no reason, except the superstition of financiers and
the fatal tendency of all things to crystallize into formulas. In the
case cited, a more generous expenditure upon such things as municipal
houses would do more to encourage Art than expenditure upon art
galleries, if at the same time means could be devised whereby genuine
and not commercial architects could be employed to build them. It is
certain that the substantially-built houses and cottages ot the past
were never built to earn dividends, and we shall never be able to house
the poorest classes so long as we do expect these returns. The fact is
that <em>in really healthy finance, as in life, there is no
formula</em>, and it is precisely because modern reformers have never
seriously questioned the truth of modern principles of finance that they
are powerless to introduce really effective measures of social
reform.</p>
<p>Another instance of the failure of Collectivism comes out in the
Fabian tract entitled “Twentieth Century Politics, a policy of National
Efficiency,” by Mr. Sidney Webb. In this tract Mr. Webb gives an outline
of what he considers should constitute the political programme of a
really progressive reform party. After dealing separately with
particular reforms, Mr. Webb passes on to consider ways and means of
effecting them. And here he is beaten. For the life of him he cannot see
where the impetus to carry them into effect is to come from. And so, in
desperation, he proposes a measure to artificially stimulate political
activity, which is worthy of “Punch,” but is quite wasted in a Fabian
Tract.</p>
<p>Recognizing that the Local Government Board has always to be coercing
its local authorities to secure the National minimum, Mr. Webb says:
“for anything beyond that minimum, the wise minister would mingle
premiums with his pressure. He would by his public speeches, by personal
interviews with mayors and town clerks, and by the departmental
publications, set on foot the utmost possible emulation among the
various local governing bodies, as to which could make the greatest
strides in municipal activity. We already have the different towns
compared, quarter by quarter, in respect to their death rates, but at
present only crudely, unscientifically, and perfunctorily. Why should
not the Local Government Board avowedly put all the local governing
bodies of each class into honorary competition with one another by an
annual investigation of municipal efficiency, working out their
statistical marks for excellence in drainage, water supply, paving,
cleansing, watching and lighting, housing, hospital accommodation,
medical service, sickness experience and mortality, and publicly
classifying them all according to the result of the examination? Nay, a
ministry keenly inspired with a passion for national efficiency, would
call into play every possible incentive to local improvement. The King
might give a ‘Shield of Honour’ to the local authority which had made
the greatest progress in the year, together with a knighthood to the
mayor and a Companionship of the Bath to the clerk, the engineer, and
the medical officer of health. On the other hand, the six or eight
districts which stood at the bottom of the list would be held up to
public opprobrium, while the official report on their shortcomings might
be sent by post to every local elector, in the hope that public
discussion would induce the inhabitants to choose more competent
administrators.” (Presumably Mr. Webb would accept Mr. Mallock’s
definition of the modern conception of progress, as an improvement which
can be tested by statistics, just as education is an improvement that
can be tested by examinations.)</p>
<p>The most interesting of all the contradictions in which Collectivism
has become involved, and which more than any other exposes the weakness
of the position of its advocates is one which during the late war split
the party in two; for while all Collectivists recognized that the war
was a commercial one, waged in the interests of unscrupulous South
African financiers, only part of them declared against it on the grounds
of its manifest injustice, the remainder arguing that the best policy
for Collectivists was to allow the war to run its course, for the reason
that as internationalism and not nationalism was the condition of the
future, a united South Africa would, notwithstanding the present
injustice, hasten the Collectivist millennium.</p>
<p>Now both these positions are valid according to the theories of
Collectivism. The first is a necessary deduction from the position
Collectivists have assumed respecting the morality of trade. Recognizing
the growth of capitalism to be the cause of the present evils in
society, they were perfectly justified in opposing its encroachments.
Yet, taking their stand on this ground, they come into collision with
their own theory of social evolution, which teaches them that the growth
of capitalistic control and of internationalism is a necessary step in
the development of society towards the social millennium. While again,
those who took their stand on the social evolution of Collectivism found
themselves in the unfortunate position of having to compromise with all
the evils which they set out to eradicate.</p>
<p>What, then, is the significance of Collectivism? Is it a product
merely of the disease of Society, or a sign of health in the body
politic? The answer is that it contains the elements of both.
Collectivism came into existence to do a definite work, with the
fulfilment of which it will assuredly disappear. As Liberalism appeared
in opposition to the corrupt oligarchies of the eighteenth century, so
Collectivism has come into existence to correct the evils which
Liberalism brought with it—to dispel the <em>laissez-faire</em> notions
of the Manchester school—to expose the inhumanities of commercialism—to
re-awaken the moral sense of society, and to restore to it the lost
ideal of a corporate life. To Collectivism we are indebted for these
ideas, and in their affirmation it has amply justified its existence. It
may be, also, that the statistical method which it has pursued, though
impossible from the point of view of social re-construction, was yet the
only way of impressing certain broad truths on the national mind. It has
indeed set forces in motion which may yet be turned in the direction of
true social re-construction. But just as Liberalism failed because it
had to use the plutocracy as the force with which to effect its purpose,
so Collectivism must fail because it has had to make its appeal to the
crowd.</p>
<p>Feeling comes nearer to truth than logic, and in the hesitation of
the masses to respond to his appeal, the Collectivist may, if he will,
see the condemnation of his own measures. The people would be right in
neglecting this appeal; in so acting there is unconscious wisdom. The
people feel instinctively that Government is not their affair; it leads
them out of their depth, and with true inspiration hitherto they have
refused to interfere where they cannot understand. They are right also
in another and profounder sense. Not only is their indifference a sign
that politics have moved out of contact with actuality, but they
instinctively feel that Utopia does not lie along the road the
Collectivist indicates; for in its appeal Collectivism made one great
and fundamental error. It has sought to remedy the evils occasioned by
the individual avarice of the few by an appeal to the avarice of the
many—as if Satan could cast out Satan.</p>
</section>
<section id="social-evolution" class="level1">
<h1>Social Evolution</h1>
<p>The underlying cause of this failure of Collectivism to fulfil the
conditions required for the establishment of a sound social system is
that in concentrating its attention too exclusively upon the material
evils existing in Society it loses sight of the spiritual side of the
problem; for indeed, rightly considered, the evils which the
Collectivist seeks to eradicate are ultimately nothing but the more
obtrusive symptoms of an internal spiritual disease. Religion, art and
philosophy have in these latter days suffered a serious decline, and the
social problem, as popularly understood, is the attendant symptom.</p>
<p>The truth of this is borne in upon us when we view the present state
of things from the standpoint of social evolution. We may then see how
the growth of this external material problem coincides at every point
with an internal spiritual decline, which separating religion, art and
philosophy from life, has plunged Society into the throes of
materialism, with its concomitants of ugliness and money-making, the
reckless pursuit of which throughout the nineteenth century has left us
for our heritage the Rings, Trusts and Monopolies which exploit Society
to-day. For had the spiritual forces in Society not dwindled into
impotence, social evolution would not thus have tended towards the
ignoble ideal of Collectivism, but towards that finer individualism upon
which the Socialism of the future must be founded.</p>
<p>To understand how these things are related we must go back to the
time of the Renaissance in Italy, when the effort was made to graft the
ideas of antiquity upon the Christian nations of Europe. The
civilization of the Middle Ages was undoubtedly a lapse from that of
Paganism, in that the freedom of thought formerly permitted was
everywhere stamped out by the dogmas of Christianity. Yet, strangely
enough, though from one point of view this lapse is to be regretted, it
achieved a useful work, for in addition to bracing the moral fibre it
became the means of enlarging the experience of the race. If it put
boundaries to the intellect, it thereby enlarged the boundaries of the
imagination. For it was precisely because in the Middle Ages men had
their minds at rest about the thousand and one doubts and difficulties
which beset the pursuit of the intellectual life, that they were able to
develop that sense of romantic beauty which enabled them to build the
cathedrals and abbeys which cover Europe.</p>
<p>And so, without committing ourselves to the unlikely theory that the
Middle Ages were in every respect an ideal age, and while certain that
in many respects that time suffers in comparison with our own, I think
we must admit its superiority in some directions. It was greater than
our own in that it possessed a “sense of the large proportions of
things,” and according to its lights it pursued perfection. For pursuit
of religion and art were then the serious things of life, while commerce
and politics, which have to-day usurped our best energies, were strictly
subordinated to these attributes of perfection. The result of this
condition of things, in its reaction upon Society, was that men found it
possible to put into practice the dictum “Love thy neighbour as
thyself”; and the principle of mutual aid became everywhere recognized
in the structure of society. Each section of the community had its own
appropriate duties to perform, while any confusion of function was
jealously guarded against. In the cities the craftsmen and merchants
were organized into guilds; the former for their mutual protection and
education, and for the maintenance of fine standards of quality in
production, and the latter for facilitating the exchange and
distribution of merchandise. On the other hand, the land held in large
fiefs under the feudal system by the nobility was formed and
administered on a carefully organized system, while the political status
of each individual was defined and guaranteed by feudal law and the
universal code of morality supplied by the teachings, and enforced by
the authority of the Roman Church.</p>
<p>Similarly, when we consider the external life of that age, what most
impresses us is the marvellous and universal beauty of everything that
has survived to our own time. The mediaeval period was not only great in
its architecture, but the very humblest forms of craftsmanship, even the
utensils, were beautiful. What a contrast to our day, where ugliness
just as universal. It matters little where we look, in the city or the
suburb, in the garden or in the house; at our dress or our furnishings;
wherever modernity is to be found, vulgarity is also there. For this
ugliness knows no exception save in the work of an insignificant and
cultivated minority who are in conscious opposition to the present order
of society. The Renaissance brought about this change by cutting at the
roots of traditionwhich hitherto had been the support of the Middle
Ages.</p>
<p>The sense of a consecutive tradition has so completely disappeared
from modern life, that it is difficult for most of us to realize what it
means. To greater or lesser extent in the form or custom or habit it is
always present with us in debased forms. Yet this is a different thing
from that living tradition which survived until the Renaissance, the
meaning of which will be best understood by considering its relation to
the arts.</p>
<p>Tradition then, in relation to the arts, may be defined as a current
language of design, and, indeed, design in the Middle Ages bears a
striking resemblance to the language of speech, in that the faculty of
design was not as it is to-day, the exclusive possession of a caste—a
body of men who give prescriptions for the craftsman to dispense—but,
like language, was a common possession of the whole people. Certain
traditional ways of working, certain ideas of design and technique were
universally recognized, so that when the craftsman was called upon to
design he was not, like his modern successor, compelled to create
something out of nothing, but had this tradition ready to hand as the
vehicle of expression understood by all. It was thus that the arts and
crafts of former times were identical—the artist was always a craftsman,
while the craftsman was always an artist. In the production of
architecture no architect was employed in the modern sense to conceive
and supervise every detail, since as every craftsman was in some degree
an artist, it was the practice of each craft to supply its own details
and ornaments, the craftsman being subject only to such general control
as was necessary to secure a unity of effect. Architecture was thus a
great cooperative art, the expression of the national life and
character.</p>
<p>We realize, perhaps, more fully what tradition means when we compare
the conditions of craftsmanship in those days with those which obtain
to-day. The modern craftsman, deprived of the guidance of a healthy
tradition, is surrounded on all sides by forms which have persisted,
though debased and vulgarized, while the thought which created them has
been lost. Consequently, he uses them not merely without any perception
of their meaning, but as he does not realize that they ever had any
meaning, he has as much chance of making himself intelligible as a man
whose speech is a hopeless jargon of all tongues, and who has lost the
capacity of realizing that any word he uses has ever actually had a
definite meaning.</p>
<p>In these circumstances the designer or craftsman of to-day has a task
of far greater magnitude to perform in order to produce creditable work
than had his predecessors. It is not merely a question of possessing
good taste, since before he can design he must recover for himself a
language of expression. He must, therefore, be not merely an artist, but
an “etymologist of forms,” so to speak, in addition. How, then, can we
wonder if little good work is produced?</p>
<p>Similarly we find the absence or degradation of tradition exercises
its baneful influence in every department of life, for just as the
craftsman cannot design beautifully because he has lost hold of a living
tradition of design, so men are unnatural and inhuman because they have
lost the art of right living, spontaneity and instinct having given
place to conventions and fashions which exercise an intangible tyranny
over their victims. Incidentally I would refer to the corroborative
testimony of Mr. Bernard Shaw, who emphasizes the same truth in “Man and
Superman.” Mr. Shaw observes that English critics disapproved of Zola’s
works not because they considered them immoral, but because never having
been taught to speak decently about such things, they were without a
language by which to express their ideas.</p>
<p>To return to our subject: I said that the Renaissance, by cutting at
the roots of tradition, brought about the changed state of things we see
around us to-day. In seeking to liberate man from the fetters of the
Middle Ages the Renaissance unfortunately destroyed what was really good
and valuable.</p>
<p>Without minimizing in the least the ultimate benefits which the
growth of the spirit of criticism stimulated by the Renaissance has in
store for the human race, the development of that spirit has so far been
attended with disastrous consequences. It is admitted that by
undermining the authority of the Church and the Bible, criticism has
largely destroyed the spirit of consecration to ideals, but it is not
generally recognized that this same spirit operating upon the arts has
brought about their decline, by separating them from life. First we see
the gradual formation of canons of taste; then follows the growth of
academies which impose rigid classical standards upon the people, and
finally, tradition, which has hitherto been the source of vitality in
the arts, is everywhere extinguished and a complete divorce is effected
between Art and Life.</p>
<p>Art, ceasing to be the vehicle of expression for the whole people,
now becomes a play-thing for the connoisseur and the
<em>dilettante</em>, hidden away in galleries and museums, while Life,
having lost the power of refined expression, crystallizes into
conventions and becomes ugly in all its manifestations.</p>
<p>Simultaneously with this separation of art from life comes the
separation of the artist from the craftsman. The fine arts having turned
their back upon their humble brethren, craftsmanship everywhere
degenerates into manufacture—uniformity having supplanted variety as the
ideal of production, machines are invented for multiplying wares.
Factories are built to contain the machinery, and labour is organized
for the purpose of working it, while universal markets arise through the
desire of avaricious manufacturers to find some temporary escape from
the evils of over-production. And now, when supply has got ahead of
demand, comes a complete divorce between production and use—owing to the
circumstance that under such conditions, speculation, and not human
need, becomes the motive force of production. Business and money-making
become the all-absorbing interest of life, while democracy takes its
rise in the seething discontent engendered by the growth of such
conditions simultaneously with the degeneration of the Guilds into close
corporations, and the subsequent exclusion of the journeyman, who is
thereby deprived of the position he formerly held in the social
scheme.</p>
<p>Such would appear to be the true interpretation of social
evolution—Religion, Art and Philosophy having separated themselves from
life, business, money-making and politics, hitherto subordinated to the
pursuit of these other attributes of perfection, become the all
absorbing interests of life. To this reversal of the natural order of
things is to be attributed the growth of the social problem.</p>
<p>What the future has in store for us it is indeed difficult to say. It
would seem that the present system is doomed to collapse through its own
internal rottenness. Commercialism will reap as it has sown—a social
catastrophe is clearly its fit and proper harvest. For a century we have
been putting off the evil consequences of unregulated production by
dumping our surpluses in foreign markets; but this cannot continue
indefinitely, for the problem which on a small scale should have been
boldly faced a century ago, when machinery was first introduced, will
have to be dealt with on a gigantic scale. The foreigner, who was once
our customer, has now become our competitor; and so instead of expanding
markets we have to face the problem of contracting markets. The
appearance therefore of a large and ever-increasing unemployed class
becomes inevitable. The probability is that this phenomenon will make
its appearance in America, where industrial conditions are fast ripening
for such a catastrophe. Until quite recently America was occupied not so
much in the production of wares as in manufacture of machinery. It is
obvious that when all this machinery becomes engaged in actual
production the output available for exportation will be enormously
increased; and it is stated on very good authority that the competition
we have already experienced from America is as nothing in comparison
with what we are likely to encounter during the next few years.
Meanwhile, the growth of Trusts, Combines and Monopolies, by eliminating
the waste consequent upon competition, tends in the same direction.</p>
<p>Under these circumstances, we shall be well advised to prepare for
eventualities. Though unable to save existing society, it may yet be
possible to build something out of its ruins.</p>
</section>
<section id="the-sphere-of-political-reform" class="level1">
<h1>The Sphere of Political Reform</h1>
<p>In passing to the constructive side of our theme, it is first
necessary to realize clearly that as commercialism, not competition, is
the evil from which modern society suffers; the real battles of reform
are to be fought in the industrial, not in the political arena. To
abolish commercialism it is necessary to transfer the control of
industry from the hands of the financier into those of the craftsman,
and as this change is ultimately dependent upon such things as the
recovery of a more scrupulous honesty in respect to our trade
relationships, the restoration of living traditions of handicraft, and
the emergence of nobler conceptions of life in general, it is evident
that the nature of the reforms is such as to place the centre of gravity
of the reform movement outside the sphere of politics.</p>
<p>At the same time it is well to remember that, though the solution is
not a political one it has, nevertheless, a political aspect, for in
this endeavour to reform industry the legislature may assist.
Recognizing the truth that nobler conceptions of life are essential to
the salvation of society, and that the desired change should be in the
direction of simpler conditions of life, the legislature can greatly
facilitate such a change by the wise expenditure of that portion of the
surplus wealth of the nation which they would derive from the taxation
of unearned incomes. In the long run it is the expenditure of surplus
wealth which determines in what direction industrial energy shall be
employed; and just as foolish expenditure is the forerunner of
depression and decay, so wise expenditure imparts health and vigour to
the body politic. “The vital question for individual and for nation,” as
Ruskin said, “is not, how much do they make? but to what purpose do they
spend?”</p>
<p>As to the way in which the expenditure of wealth could be used to
facilitate the spiritual regeneration of society, the first condition of
success is a more generous and magnanimous spirit than is customary
to-day; in a word, we should not expect too much for our money, since,
until the spirit of society is changed in this respect, there can be no
possibility of returning to simpler conditions of life. Until then
sweating, jerry-work, dishonesty and quackery will remain with us, and
the producers will continue to be slave-driven.</p>
<p>The evil, moreover, does not end here. The attendant symptom of this
pernicious system is that with our minds bent always upon making
bargains, it comes about that less regard is paid to the intrinsic value
than to the market value of things, and we thus create conditions under
which the gulf separating the two is ever widening, until finally the
anti-climax of the ideal of wealth accumulation is reached in the
circumstance that it becomes daily more impossible to buy things worth
possessing. To reverse this unnatural order, therefore, and to let our
choice be determined by the intrinsic value than to the market value of
things, is the second condition of successful expenditure.</p>
<p>There are two directions in which an immediate increase of
expenditure is called for in the national interest. In the first place
there can be no doubt that a serious attempt should be made to revive
agriculturein this country, for apart from its temporary commercial
value, agriculture has an intrinsic value as a factor in the national
life, in that it strengthens the economic position of the country at its
base. Secondly, a substantial increase should be made in our national
expenditure upon art, particularly by a more generous and sympathetic
patronage of the humbler crafts; for not only would such expenditure
tend to relieve the pressure of competition, but since the true root and
basis of all art lies in the health and vigour of the handicrafts, a
force would be definitely set in motion which would at once regenerate
industry and restore beauty to life—industry and beauty being two of the
most powerful factors in the spiritual regeneration of the race.</p>
<p>In answer to some who complained that Athens was over-adorned, even
as a proud and vain woman tricks herself out with jewels, Pericles
replied that “superfluous wealth should be laid out on such works as,
when executed, would be eternal monuments of the glory of their city,
works which, during their execution, would diffuse a universal plenty;
for as so many kinds of labour and such a variety of instruments and
materials were requisite to these undertakings, every art would be
exerted, every hand employed, almost the whole city would be in pay, and
be at the same time both adorned and supported by itself.” Such was the
old-time solution of the unemployed problem; both the spiritual and
material needs of the people are here provided for.</p>

<h1>The Guild System</h1>
<p>The conclusion to be deduced from the the last chapter was that the
wise expenditure of surplus wealth, and, indeed, all exercise of wisdom,
demands that man be spiritually regenerated.</p>
<p>It is obvious that by spiritual regeneration something very different
is meant from the morbid and sickly sentimentality which very often
passes for spirituality to-day; rather must we be understood to mean the
recovery by society of that “sense of the large proportion of things” as
Pater calls it, which in all great ages of spiritual activity was in a
greater or less degree the common possession of the whole people, and
while giving a man a new scale of values may be said to completely
change the individual nature. In this connexion it is well to remember
that though in one sense the individual nature is unchangeable, the fact
remains that the intellectual atmosphere which we breathe will determine
the particular mode in which it will express itself; and that whereas a
prejudiced and sectarian atmosphere, by refusing the higher nature its
medium of expression, will encourage the expression of the lower nature,
so a wider outlook on life, an atmosphere in which the nature and
essential unity of things are more clearly discerned, will by
transmuting values keep the selfish motives more effectually in
subjection. It is thus that the recovery of the sense of the large
proportion of things by the individual members of the community must
precede all substantial reform. It is this sense which is the great
socializer, making always for Collective action. There can be no
Socialism without it.</p>
<p>No better example could be found of the way in which its absence
militates against social reform than the common attitude of sociological
thinkers towards the present proposal of re-establishing the Guild
system in society. One and all of them, without further inquiry, dismiss
Ruskin’s proposal as a harking back to Mediaevalism merely because the
links which separated his proposals from practical politics were not in
his day capable of being forged. In all this we see that characteristic
failure of the modern mind to distinguish clearly between what is
immediately practicable, and what must ultimately be brought to pass,
and its incapacity to adjust the demands of the present to the needs of
the future.</p>
<p>Tested by such principles the restoration of the Guilds will appear
not merely reasonable but inevitable. Being social, religious, and
political as well as industrial institutions, the Guilds postulated in
their organization the essential unity of life. And so, just as it is
certain that the reattainment of intellectual unity must precede the
reorganization of society on a Co-operative basis, it is equally certain
that the same or similar forms of social organization will be necessary
again in the future.</p>
<p>For the present we shall regard them merely as political and
industrial organizations, for these are the aspects which immediately
concern us. The question of their restoration as religious and social
organizations is outside the scope of the present volume, depending as
it does upon the settlement of many theological and scientific questions
which we do not feel qualified to discuss. To give the reader some idea
of what the Guild system really was one cannot perhaps do better than
quote from a lecture by Professor Lethaby on “Technical Education in the
Building Trade” (for though this has particular reference to the
building trades, the same conditions obtained in every trade), and to
supplement this by adding the rules of the Cloth Weavers of Flanders as
given by William Morris in “Architecture, Industry and Wealth.”</p>
<p>“In the Middle Ages,” says Professor Lethaby, “the masons’ and
carpenters’ guilds were faculties or colleges of education in those
arts, and every town was, so to say, a craft university. Corporations of
masons, carpenters, and the like, were established in the town; each
craft aspired to have a college hall. The universities themselves had
been well named by a recent historian ‘Scholars’ Guilds,’ The guild
which recognized all the customs of its trade guaranteed the relations
of the apprentice and master craftsman with whom he was placed; but he
was really apprenticed to the craft as a whole, and ultimately to the
city, whose freedom he engaged to take up. He was, in fact, a graduate
of his craft college and wore its robes. At a later stage the apprentice
became a companion or a bachelor of his art, or by producing a
masterwork, the thesis of his craft, he was admitted a master. Only then
was he permitted to become an employer of labour or was admitted as one
of the governing body of his college. As a citizen, City dignities were
open to him. He might become the master in building some abbey or
cathedral, or as king’s mason become a member of the royal household,
the acknowledged great master of his time in mason-craft.) With such a
system was it so very wonderful that the buildings of the Middle Ages,
which were indeed wonderful, should have been produced?”</p>
<p>Let us now glance at the rules of the Cloth Weavers of Flanders. “No
master to employ more than three journeymen in his workshop; no one
under any pretence to have more than one workshop; the wages fixed per
day, and the number of hours also; no work should be done on holidays;
if piece-work (which was allowed) the price per yard fixed, but only so
much and no more to be done in a day. No one allowed to buy wool
privately, but at open sales duly announced. No mixing of wools allowed;
the man who uses English wool (the best) not to have any other on his
premises. English and foreign cloth not allowed to be sold. Workmen not
belonging to the Commune not admitted unless hands fell short. Most of
these rules and many others may be considered to have been made in the
direct interest of the workmen. Now for the safeguards to the public.
The workman must prove that he knows his craft duly; he serves as
apprentice first, and then as journeyman, after which he is admitted as
a master if he can manage capital enough to set up three looms besides
his own, which of course he could generally do. Width of web is settled;
colour of list according to quality; no work to be done in a frost or
bad light. All cloth must be ‘walked’ or ‘fulled’ a certain time, and to
a certain width, and so on and so on. Finally, every piece of cloth must
stand the test of examination, and if it fall short, goes back to the
maker, who is fined; if it comes up to the standard it is marked as
satisfactory.”</p>
<p>The point to remember in all this is that the individual craftsman
was privileged, and privileged he must be if he is to remain a
conscientious producer. For privilege not only protected him from
unscrupulous rivals but also secured him leisure at his work—a very
necessary condition of good work. The framers of these regulations
grasped one great sociological fact: which is not clearly understood
to-day, namely, that rogues are very dangerous men and that it is
impossible to keep control over them by granting that measure of liberty
which permits of unfair competition. I say <em>unfair</em> competition,
because the Guilds did not aim at the suppression of competition, but at
that particular form of it which we designate commercial competition. By
preventing the lower competition for cheapness the plane of the struggle
was raised and a competition of quality was the result. This was of
course thoroughly healthy and stimulating, for it secured in the
industrial struggle not the ‘survival of the fittest’ but the ‘survival
of the best’ in the broadest sense of the word, as the general
excellence of mediaeval craftsmanship abundantly proves.</p>
<p>That the Guild System is the only system of organization under which
production can be healthy I am fully persuaded; but whether it will
again be applied to distribution is perhaps open to question. The
probability is that the distribution of raw material in the future will
be undertaken by the State under some form of Collectivist
administration with nationalized railways.With regard to the
nationalization of the land, this will probably be one of the last
reforms we shall achieve. For if it be true, as Mr. Edward Carpenter has
pointed out, that the crust of conventionality and artificiality in
which the modern world is embedded is a change or growth coincident with
the growth of property and the ideas flowing from it, does it not follow
that so long as this crust of conventionality remains the
nationalization of the land must remain impracticable, since, so long as
the people are addicted to their present habits and modes of life they
will rally to the support of a system the abolition of which would
individually threaten their social existence.</p>
<p>As to the form which the Government of the future will take it is not
improbable that the division of function between the Upper and Lower
Chambers will continue, with this difference, that whereas the lower
chamber would be elected by the people in their private capacity the
members of the Upper Chamber would be nominated by the Guilds.</p>
<p>Such an arrangement would seem to secure for democracy what at
present it appears to be incapable of securing for itself—the leadership
of the best and wisest. Accurate thinking does not readily lend itself
to platform oratory, and so it happens that owing to a disability to
enforce their views at public meetings the community is deprived of the
services of a large section of the most thoughtful members of the
community. The creation, however, of an upper chamber whose members were
the nominees of the Guilds would remedy this defect by removing oratory
from the list of necessary qualifications for political life, and with
the wisest at the helm the present anarchic tendencies of democracy
would be checked; the principle of authority on a popular basis would be
thereby established, while a balance of power between the various
interests on the State would be automatically maintained.</p>
<p>Should this prediction prove to be a true one, and should Society
again revert to the Guild system, we shall be in a position to realize
their value more adequately. With our knowledge of the consequences of
unfettered individual competition, society will be able to guard itself
more securely against the growth of those evils of which we have had so
bitter an experience. And so while the prospect of social salvation
inspires us with hope, it may be well to remember that society is not to
be saved by the establishment of any social <em>régime</em>, since,
until each individual member of society has sufficient moral courage to
resist the temptation to pursue his own private ends at the expense of
the common-weal, and possesses the mental outlook necessary to enable
him at all times to know in what direction the best interests of the
community lie, social institutions once established will tend inevitably
to degenerate, for inasmuch as all institutions are but the expression
of national life and character, the integrity of the individual can
alone secure the integrity of the State.</p>
</section>
<section id="how-the-guilds-may-be-restored" class="level1">
<h1>How the Guilds may be Restored</h1>
<p>Passing on now to consider the problem of ways and means of
re-introducing the Guild System, the first fact we must grasp is that
the Guilds cannot be re-established by further evolution upon the lines
along which society is now travelling, but by the development of those
forces which run counter to what maybe considered the normal line of
social evolution.</p>
<p>Of these, the first force which will be instrumental in restoring the
Guilds is the Trade Union movement. Already the unions with their
elaborate organizations exercise many of the functions which were
performed by the Guilds; such, for instance, as the regulation of wages
and hours of labour, in addition to the more social duty of giving
timely help to the sick and unfortunate. Like the Guilds, the Unions
have grown from small beginnings, until they now control whole trades.
Like the Guilds also, they are not political creations, but voluntary
organizations which have arisen spontaneously to protect the weaker
members of society against the oppression of the more powerful. In three
respects only, as industrial organizations, are they differentiated from
the Guilds. In the first place, they accept no responsibility for the
quality of the wares they produce. Secondly, masters are not permitted
to become members of these organizations; and thirdly, they do not
possess monopolies in their separate trades.</p>
<p>Of course, these are very important differences—differences in fact
which for the time being are insurmountable. The circumstance that
modern industry is so completely in the grip of the financier and
speculator is alone sufficient to prevent any speedy transformation of
the Unions into Guilds, since so long as it exists it is difficult to
see how masters and men could belong to the same organization. The
question, therefore, which we require to answer is this: Will industry
continue to be controlled by the financier, or are there grounds for
supposing that the master-craftsman will supplant him in the future?</p>
<p>My answer to this question is, that we have very good grounds for
supposing that the craftsman will supplant the financier. Speculation
brings its own ruin. It is already ruining the workman, and in
proportion as it succeeds in this it will undermine effective demand,
and so ultimately destroy the very source of its dividends. This
prediction is based on the assumption that society will quietly
acquiesce in the operation of the speculator, but the probability being,
as has already been shown, that a revolution will result, the ruin will
be considerably hastened. Meanwhile, there are two agencies at work in
modern society which are destined to supplant the large factory by the
small workshop. The first of these is the increasing use which is made
of electricity for the distribution of power at a cheap rate, and the
second is the gradual raising of the standard of taste and
craftsmanship.</p>
<p>Respecting these, it is easy to see that just as the introduction of
steam power created the large factory by concentrating industry, so
electricity, by facilitating the distribution of power, will render
possible the small workshop in the future. It is true that the growth of
the factory system preceded the introduction of steam power and
machinery. This, however, in turn was preceded by a decline in
craftsmanship which, by substituting uniformity for variety in the
practice of industry, made such development possible. And so it may
fairly be assumed that just in proportion as the standard of taste and
craftsmanship is raised, the factory system will tend to disappear. The
practice of good craftsmanship demands that care be taken with the
quality of the work; it demands that work be done leisurely; that the
worker shall receive a fair price for his work and that he shall have
security of employment. All these things commercialism and the factory
system deny him and must deny him, for the two are essentially
antagonistic. The victory of the one must mean the death of the
other.</p>
<p>This brings us to the consideration of the second force which is
preparing the way for the restoration of the Guilds, namely, the Arts
and Crafts movement, which exists to promote the revival of handicraft.
Recognizing that the true root and basis of all art lies in the
handicrafts, and that under modern conditions the artist and craftsman
have, to their mutual detriment, become fatally separated, the Arts and
Crafts movement sought to remedy this defect by promoting their
reunion.</p>
<p>Writing on the Revival of Handicrafts and Design,Mr. Walter Crane
says: “The movement indeed represents, in some sense, a revolt against
the hard mechanical life and its insensibility to beauty (quite another
thing to ornament). It is a protest against that so-called industrial
progress which produces shoddy wares, the cheapness of which is paid for
by the lives of their producers and the degradation of their users. It
is a protest against the turning of men into machines, against
artificial distinctions in art, and against making the immediate market
value, or possibly of profit, the chief test of artistic merit. It also
advances the claim of all and each to the common possession of beauty in
things common and familiar, and would awaken the sense of this beauty,
deadened and depressed as it now too often is, either on the one hand by
luxurious superfluities, or on the other by the absence of the commonest
necessities and the gnawing anxiety for the means of livelihood; not to
speak of the every-day ugliness to which we have accustomed our eyes,
confused by the flood of false taste or darkened by the hurried life of
modern towns in which huge aggregations of humanity exist, equally
removed from both art and nature, and their kindly and refining
influences.</p>
<p>“It asserts, moreover, the value of the practice of handicraft as a
good training for the faculties, and as a most valuable counter-action
to that overstraining of purely mental effort under the fierce
competitive conditions of the day; apart from the very wholesome and
real pleasure in the fashioning of a thing with claims to art and
beauty, the struggle with and triumph over technical necessities which
refuse to be gainsaid. And, finally, thus claiming for man this
primitive and common delight in common things made beautiful, it makes,
through art, the great socializer for a common and kindred life, for
sympathetic and healthy fellowship, and demands conditions under which
your artist and craftsman shall be free.</p>
<p>“‘See how a great a matter a little fire kindle th.’ Some may think
this is an extensive programme—a remote ideal for a purely artistic
movement to touch. Yet if the revival of art and handicraft is not a
mere theatrical and imitative impulse; if it is not merely to gratify a
passing whim of fashion, or demand of commerce; if it has reality and
roots of its own; if it is not merely a little glow of colour at the end
of a sombre day—it can hardly mean less than what I have written. It
must mean either the sunset or the dawn.”</p>
<p>We do not, of course, need to take this war-cry at its face value. It
is one thing to declare a principle, it is another to reduce it to
practice. And looking at the Arts and Crafts movement to-day it seems to
resemble the sunset rather than the dawn. It cannot be denied that up to
the present, while the movement has succeeded in popularizing the idea,
it has for the most part failed to reduce it to practice. A favoured
few, possessed of means or social advantages, have succeeded in
establishing themselves before the public, but the number is
comparatively insignificant. The majority, after struggling for a few
years, have lost heart, and a depression of the movement has followed in
consequence.</p>
<p>Sunset, however, is followed by dawn, and while we frankly recognize
that the movement is suffering from a reaction, we are not justified in
concluding that failure is its inevitable doom:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>  Tasks in hours of insight willed</p>
<p>Can be through hours of gloom fulfilled,</p>
</blockquote>
<p>says Matthew Arnold. The movement is fortifying itself upon more
impregnable strongholds, for viewed from the inside it may be seen that
the centre of gravity of the movement is being slowly transferred from
artistic and <em>dilettante</em> circles to the trade. Hitherto the
movement has suffered from weakness in three directions. The first was
its isolation from the trade; the second, the general absence of
intellectual patronage—fashion having been the guiding and controlling
influence with the vast majority of its patrons;–and the third has been
lack of knowledge as to the sociological bearings of the movement, such
as would have enabled it to direct its energies in the most effective
way.</p>
<p>The gulf which has hitherto separated the movement from the trade
shows a tendency to become bridged over. In many directions there are
signs that the trade is being gradually leavened; the wave of feeling
which created the Arts and Crafts movement has at length reached the
workers, and there is good reason to believe that the first condition of
widespread success—namely, the cooperation and goodwill of the
trade—will ere long be attained.</p>
<p>The patronage afforded to the crafts by fashionable circles, if it
has not altogether ceased, is rapidly decreasing, and though, in the
general absence of intelligent patronage the Arts and Crafts movement
has every reason to be grateful to fashion for keeping the flame alive,
we are persuaded that the withdrawal of such patronage will prove to be
no evil, since, so long as the movement accustomed itself to look to
fashion for its support, the work produced must necessarily be of an
exotic nature, while the really valuable work which the movement stands
for, namely, the restoration of beauty to life, is retarded.</p>
<p>The greatest weakness of all, however, is that hitherto the movement
has never clearly understood its own sociological bearings—a defect
which the present volume aims at remedying. In the long run I am
persuaded that the movement will never be able to make much headway
until it possesses a social theory which accords with its artistic
philosophy—since until then it can never have a common meeting ground
with the public; it will be unable to get support of the right sort, and
without such support its value as a force in social reconstruction will
be impaired.</p>
<p>I feel well advised in ranking the Arts and Crafts movement as one of
the forces of social reconstruction, and that not merely because art is
the eternal enemy of commercialism, but because of the peculiar relation
in which it stands to modern society. This is the first time in history
that art has progressed in advance of the age in which it is practised.
Hitherto new movements in art have been preceded by popular movements
which have prepared a public capable of understanding them. Thus, the
Humanists in Italy prepared the way for the revival of Classical
Architecture at the time of the Renaissance, and similarly the
Anglo-Catholic movement provided a public for the Gothic Revivalists and
the pre-Raphaelites. I cannot but believe that there is great
significance in this fact and that art is one of the great forces of
social reconstruction destined to roll back the wave of commercialism.
At any rate, art is no longer able to follow the trend of the age, and
sooner or later it will have to choose between being thrust out of
society by the ever-increasing pressure of commercial conditions of
existence, and definitely taking in hand the work of social
reconstruction.</p>
<p>The obvious way in which this is to be accomplished is by joining
hands with other reform movements. Instead of seeking to understand each
other, reformers have attempted solutions of their own separate
problems, regardless of the efforts of others to solve kindred
difficulties, with the result that one and all have lost their way amid
the expediencies and compromises of practical politics. Hence it would
appear that the immediate work before us is the promotion of
intellectual unity by a return to fundamentals, the result of which
would be not only to unite the different sections of reform movements
with each other, but to unite them with the public.</p>
<p>There are many signs that the tendency of modern thought is in this
direction. One result of the failure of all reform movements to realize
their dire6t intentions has been the growth of a general consensus of
opinion that all substantial reform demands the spiritual regeneration
of the people. On this point it is clear that sociologists, scientists,
artists, philosophical thinkers, politicians and reformers are coming to
some agreement. Moreover, it is becoming apparent to an ever increasing
body of thinkers that gambling, drink, and many other social ills have
their roots in modern industrial conditions; that so long as the
majority are compelled to follow occupations which give no scope to the
imagination and individuality of the worker, nobler conceptions of life,
in other words, spiritual regeneration, are strangled at their roots;
and that the cultivation of the aesthetic side of life is the great need
of the day.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, abstract thought is tending in the same direction. What
was ordinarily called philosophic materialism has of late years receded
very much into the background, and in its place we find a restoration of
belief in the immortality of the soul through the growing acceptance of
the doctrines of re-incarnation and karma, and the tendency to admit the
claims of mysticism. The necessity of a revival of religion of some kind
is becoming very generally admitted. Consequently we do not hear so much
of militant agnosticism as of a tendency to try and find out what are
the really essential things in religion.</p>
<p>The discoveries of modern science are confirming this tendency. One
has only to mention Sir William Crooke’s experiments with radiant light,
the Rontgen rays, the N. rays, Dewar’s liquid air experiments, the
Hertzian currents, the discovery of radium, and Mr. Butler Burke’s
investigations into the origin of life, to show that the abandonment of
the doctrine of the physical origin of life (so incompatible with
spiritualistic conceptions) is not very far distant. To the lay mind, at
any rate, the postulation by science of the existence of a universal
consciousness interpenetrating all matter as the explanation of the
contradictory results of investigations conducted by the chemist and the
physicist, the astronomer and the geologist, implies such an
abandonment. Hopeful as this tendency undoubtedly is, the prospects of
unity are still more hopeful now that the establishment of a just
standard of taste in art, in conformity with a philosophic conception of
its nature, is within sight. After a century of experiment and failure,
art is at last emerging from the cloud of darkness which through the
nineteenth century enveloped it. It is difficult for those who are not
professionally engaged in the arts to realize the enormous strides which
have been made in architecture and the crafts during the last fifteen
years, owing to the circumstance that so little good work finds its way
into the streets of our great cities. Yet the advance is remarkable. The
reason of this is that as a result of our experiments the fundamental
principles of art are becoming more generally understood. The architect
of to-day realizes that architecture is not a system of abstract
proportions to be applied indifferently to all buildings and materials,
but that, as already stated, the true root and basis of all art lies in
healthy traditions of handicraft; that, indeed, it is impossible to
detach design from the material to be used, since in its ultimate
relationships design is an inseparable part of good quality. The
discovery of this principle, which was foreshadowed by Ruskin in that
famous chapter in the “Stones of Venice” entitled “The Nature of
Gothic,” is rapidly rejuvenating modern art. Commencing with the
establishment of traditions of handicraft, architecture by reaction is
being regenerated. It is not unreasonable to expect that this new
standard will gradually find its way into the finer arts of painting and
sculpture. Painting and sculpture can never be healthy except when
practised in subordination to architecture, and as patronage of the arts
is now so grudgingly given, frequent opportunities for successful
collaboration are not likely to be forthcoming.</p>
<p>We may safely anticipate that the new ideas now germinating in the
arts will gradually find their way into other branches of activity. It
may be true, perhaps, that the aestheticism of the connoisseur is often
a very superficial thing. Nevertheless it is the stepping stone to
higher attainments; for no man in the long run can study aesthetics
apart from the realities they symbolize. The Gothic revival and the
pre-Raphaelite movement at their inception may be regarded as in many
respects superficial. Yet they have led to the discovery of truth in a
hundred fields of research; indeed it is difficult to say for what they
are not responsible. To them in the last analysis we owe the re-creation
of the whole fabric of design, while indirectly they have re-created the
past for us in a manner never understood before. Incidentally it may be
pointed out that the forces they set in motion have not only supplied
the key to the problems discussed in these pages, but have also supplied
the facts necessary for their proper statement. While again it is to the
aesthetic movement in literature that we owe the revival of interest in
folk lore, symbolism and peasant life.</p>
<p>It will be thus, as element is added to element, that a soil will be
prepared wherein new spiritual conceptions may take their rise. Ideas of
spirituality have hitherto been associated with ideas of beauty. And
just as spiritual truth is not to be expressed apart from the medium of
beautiful form, so beauty of form is not ultimately to be detached from
spiritual truth. It will be thus that the pursuit of beauty will tend to
re-awaken and to give reality to the spiritual life. Not that the
worship of beauty can ever be sufficient to constitute a religion, but
that the seeking after beauty in all relationships of life (for society
must pass through a state of self-conscious aestheticism ere beauty can
resume its proper and subordinate function) is more likely to lead us
into the vicinity of spiritual things than a breathless pursuit of
riches and ugliness.</p>
<p>Such appear to be the main outlines of an intellectual unity to which
we may reasonably look forward in the future; if, indeed, it can be
called intellectual unity, for the unity which we anticipate will
frankly recognize that the basis of all thought is emotional rather than
intellectual, that thought is nothing more than the emotions become
self-conscious—a conclusion which a modern writer has expressed in the
striking phrase: “Reason can clear away error; it can give us no new
light.”</p>
<p>Meanwhile the external conditions of modern society are cooperating
to lift the masses out of the grooves in which they move and have their
being. Rapid mechanical development has not lessened but increased the
drudgery of the world; money-making has not, as our political economists
prophesied, made the many rich, but has precipitated the masses into the
most abject poverty the world has ever seen, while free trade and
universal markets have not inaugurated an era of peace and goodwill
among nations, but have plunged society into endless wars. Hence the
majority of people to-day, feeling that the tendency of modern
civilization is to add more to the sorrow than to the joy of life, are
beginning to ask themselves what Carlyle and Ruskin were asking
themselves fifty years ago—whither modern civilization goeth. And so it
is not unreasonable to expect that the force which is to carry us back
to the Guild system is now germinating in our midst. The failure of
modern society to realize itself will result in an effort towards
finding lost roads. The people will come to connect the Golden Age with
the past again rather than with the future. And such a change is just
what is wanted to unite the people with the intellect of the age. For it
is the popular superstition exalting the present age at the expense of
the past which, more than anything else, perhaps, separates ignorant
from cultured people, who, being better informed, are, on the one hand,
unable either to take part in popular activities, and on the other, to
get a following themselves.</p>
<p>A reverence for the past, then, is the hope of the future. This is
the testimony of history. Consider what the consciousness of a glorious
past did for the Italians of the Renaissance. It was the hope of
restoring the ancient splendour of the Senate and the Republic which
created the force that gave birth to the great achievements of that era.
And though this ambition was not realized, the ideal which it inspired
in the national mind remained a force of reconstruction. In like manner
a reverence among the English people for the achievements of the Middle
Ages in architecture and the crafts, and of the Elizabethan era in
literature, would become an influence coordinating a multitude of our
national activities. The spirit of emulation which such a reverence
would engender in society, by setting certain forces in motion, would
add just those ingredients which are lacking and lead us out of the
quagmire of materialism toward the realization of a happier and more
beautiful life.</p>
<p>Evidence is not wanting that the change will be in the direction here
indicated. It is only a century ago that Sir Walter Scott thought it
necessary to apologize to his readers for his love of Gothic
Architecture. Compare England to-day with the England of 1851, with its
insolent belief in its own self-sufficiency. If external evidence be
called for, take as a common instance the development of the trade in
antique furniture and bric-a-brac, yet many of the men who set this
force in motion are still with us. Indeed, the change of feeling which
is now to be seen coming over the national mind appears to be nothing
more than a change which was consummated in the world of art
three-quarters of a century ago, for just as the eighteenth century
architects thought they had reached a state of perfection equalled only
by the ancients, so the mid-nineteenth century thought itself on the
high road towards perfection. Subsequent experience, however, revealed
the idea in each case to be illusory—a false development preparatory to
accelerated decline, since, being essentially artificial, both had moved
out of contact with actuality. And just as it was found necessary in the
arts to seek a new source of inspiration in a study of Mediaevalism, so
society by a reverence for the past may renew its lease of life. We live
the life of the past to-day in our thoughts, to-morrow we may live it in
reality. Thus hopes may be entertained that what has been may again be,
and under new conditions with new possibilities, may be again in fuller
measure and more complete perfection.</p>

<h1>Conclusion</h1>
<p>Having stated the direction in which social salvation may be sought,
it remains for us to define more precisely the immediate work which is
to be done; for, though it has been shown that the solution of our
problems depends ultimately upon the regeneration of the spiritual life
of the people, it is to be feared that such a generalization is
insufficient as a guide to action, action being based rather upon what
is sensuously apprehended in the concrete than upon what is
intellectually comprehended in the abstract. To enter further into
detail, therefore, it appears to us that the spiritual regeneration of
society might be facilitated if the reform movement could be persuaded
to concentrate its energies upon:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>The stimulation of right thinking upon social questions.</p></li>
<li><p>The restoration of a spirit of reverence for the past.</p></li>
<li><p>The dissemination of the principles of taste.</p></li>
<li><p>The teaching of the elements of morality, especially in relation
to commerce.</p></li>
<li><p>The insistence upon the necessity of of personal sacrifice as a
means to the salvation alike of the individual and of the
State.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Respecting these, the first has always been part of the reform
programme, and therefore does not require elaborating. The second is
recommended not in advocacy of a dogmatic or emotional reversion to
obsolete models, but because a reverence for what was really good and
valuable in the life of the past must not only form the basis of all
rational culture, and thereby of clear thinking in sociology as in other
topics, but because it would provide the best antidote to the iconoclasm
of the present age, with its tendency to over-rate its own importance,
thereby enabling the mind to gauge to what extent progress, and to what
extent retrogression have taken place. In a word, it is the only way of
restoring to the national mind the sense of the right proportion of
things.</p>
<p>The dissemination of taste is necessary not only to teach people how
to live reasonably, for taste is the best protection which the
individual can possess against the love of ostentation and vulgar
display, but it is a necessary condition of the abolition of
commercialism. Until we can reform popular taste it is to be feared we
shall have to submit to commercialism, since commercialism has its roots
in the vulgarity of modern life on the one hand, and the general
debasement of taste on the other. The need of the hour is not more
schools of art, producing an unlimited supply of amateur artists with an
exaggerated sense of their own capacities, but schools of taste which
would teach them how little they know.</p>
<p>Again, it is necessary to teach the principles of morality in order
to awaken people to the immorality of conventional morals.This is
especially true of the ethics of business, where precept and practice
have drifted so far apart that there is great danger of the sense of
honesty disappearing from amongst us.</p>
<p>Lastly, the insistence upon the necessity of personal sacrifice as a
means to the salvation alike of the individual and of the State is
particularly necessary to-day, because social reformers have ceased to
insist upon it. Nevertheless, sacrifice, as hitherto, remains the law of
life. To attain the higher good the lower must be sacrificed. Hence it
is that just as for the individual salvation the higher pleasures may
only be attained by the sacrifice of the lower, so the welfare of the
State demands that the individual members forego personal advantages for
the general well-being—that indeed they cultivate the spirit of those
Spartan envoys, who, when asked whether they came with a public
commission or on their own account, replied, “If successful, for the
public; if unsuccessful, for ourselves.” What a contrast to the spirit
of to-day—to the spirit which animates so many men of pious and
progressive opinions, who shuffle off their personal responsibility
wherever possible to the shoulders of the State. It is not by these, but
by those who can realize their responsibilities and are prepared to make
the necessary sacrifices, that reform will be achieved. To resist
commercialism is in these days to resist the devil in the nearest and
most obvious sense of the word, since until a man has successfully
overcome its temptation he is incapable of really valuable work, for he
will lack clearness of vision. A man may read and think as much as he
pleases, but if he be without the courage to test his conclusions by
practice he can possess no vital knowledge. His thoughts will lack
precision. It is only by living his thoughts that they may be focussed
to the surrounding circumstances of life. As was said of old, “If thine
eye be single thine whole body shall be full of light.”</p>
<p>Such is a brief outline of the changes necessary to the spiritual
regeneration of the people. In the meantime the constructive forces in
society will be unable to make much headway. For as Carlyle says, “If
you have much wisdom in your nation, you will get it faithfully
collected; for the wise love wisdom, and will search for it as for life
and salvation. If you have little wisdom you will get even that little
ill-collected, trampled under foot, reduced as near as possible to
annihilation/’ For the same reason until we can get some wisdom in the
English nation, Trades Unionism, which we have come to regard as the new
centre of order, will be too much on the defensive to work definitely
for the salvation of society, while the revival of art and handicraft,
upon which the abolition of commercialism in one sense depends, will be
unable to break down the barriers which restrict its operations to a
very limited sphere. It cannot be insisted upon too strongly that this
reform cannot be achieved unless art reformers secure the good will and
cooperation of the public. The experience of the Arts and Crafts
movement has proved conclusively that unless the public can be persuaded
to give organized support to the movement and are prepared to take a
share in the sacrifices involved, professional effort can avail
nothing.</p>
<p>And yet, do what we can, sooner or later we come into collision with
the spiritual degradation of society. So long as people persist in their
present extravagant habits of life their expenditure must always tend to
get ahead of their incomes, and they will put up with the jerry and
false in consequence. Modern life is an exact counterpart of modern art.
It is fundamentally insincere, lacks restraint, worships shams. We have,
as Carlyle says, “given up hope in the Everlasting and True, and placed
hope in the Temporary, half or wholly false.” The further we inquire
into the decadence of modern art the more we find that every aspect of
it, yea, every line of it corresponds to some trait in the national
character. It is the art of a people who have descended to every
deception for the purpose of making money. Never did popular art more
faithfully represent the national life than to-day.</p>
<p>According to the old conception, art, religion, ideas, integrity of
work, the pursuit of perfection, were looked upon as the serious things
of life, while business and money-making were subservient things,
considered relatively unimportant, for men had a reverence for the truth
and abhorrence for the false. And this we maintain is the right
conception. Except a Society acknowledge the real things of life, and be
true to them it cannot remain healthy. It is not economic causes outside
our individual control which have given rise to the social problem, but
the degradation of the spiritual which has followed the usurpation of
life by business and money-making.</p>
<p>And this is the choice we are called upon to make. Are we content to
continue living as a nation of Philistines, indifferent alike to poetry,
religion, ideas and art, worshipping vulgar success, wasting our
precious gifts in sordid speculative enterprises and our leisure in
senseless luxury, dissipation and excitement? If so we shall continue to
wallow in the troughs of commercialism, and no solution of our problems
is possible, though every voice in the land should demand it. Unless
individually we are prepared to live for the truth and to make
sacrifices for it, Society will remain as at present at the mercy of the
speculator, the sweater, the hustler, the mountebank and the adventurer.
For there can be no remedy. More important to a nation than the
acquisition of material riches is the welfare of its spiritual life.
This is the lesson the social problem has to teach us; not until it is
learned shall we emerge from the cloud of darkness in which we are
enveloped.</p>
